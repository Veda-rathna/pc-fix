AMD CPU It s also not trivial for TSMC to expand The fab being built takes years to plan and years to build Their total investment in Arizona with 1 fab is over 63 billion so it s not something they just immediately scale up to meet demand The big thing to is past 2025 2026 will AI demand remain as high as it is That s a huge bet when you re throwing around over 100 billion for 2 fab plants For TSMC it makes more sense to have issues meeting demand than it does to fully meet demand because they d screw themselves financially I m not a silicon guru so I could be oversimplifying things but this is roughly the issue It s not something I can fully confirm but it sounds like the AIB partners surprisingly still have thin margins on the 50 series due to increase sale price from NVIDIA and 20 tariffs as well And datacenter GPU s per card are worth much more money in the AI datacenter space NVIDIA has every reason to prioritize shipping datacenter GPU s and it is the much larger more profitable segment of their business They d be seen as insane if they jumped on an earnings call and forecasted less quarterly revenue because they took away from Datacenter GPU s to build more gaming

raw compute power loses it s demand when it does instead of pivoting again Neither AMD or Nvidia make their own GPUs and the fabrication side of the industry already can t keep up with their demand due to lack of capacity in the case of TSMC or lack of ability in TSMC s competitors Barriers of entry are insanely high in cutting edge semi conductors Capital expenses limited supply chains and technical ability all work really hard against new players We can talk about wanting more competition all we want but the reality of it is there s a reason there isn t It s just not very feasible currently I m not hanging any hopes on Intel either What they ve done so far is impressive but three players still isn t a lot They re showing some promise in affordable budget GPUs but it s also a pretty typical move when you re the new player to grab some market share What happens once if their GPU division reaches maturity My money s on Intel acting like Intel again", "confidence": 0.4},

higher refresh rates or otherwise marketed towards gaming will have a feature called Variable Refresh Rate often with brand names like AMD Freesync or Nvidia G Sync depending on implementation The feature allows the monitor to adjust it s refresh rate in real time to wait for the next frame to be finished before drawing effectively eliminating screen tearing as long as FPS remains within the variable range or depending on implementation a multiple of a value within that range Commonly on high refresh rate monitors the lower limit is 48hz and upper is max of the panel While the old advice of targeting just above the refresh rate of the monitor and enabling vsync so there is headroom still applies just fine to these newer displays It is now possible and usually recommended to instead target graphics settings that balance preferred visual fidelity with preferred refresh rate within range of the display For example my display is capable of 240hz with a variable refresh rate range of 48hz to 240hz the high refresh rate has integer multiples of common TV Movie frame rates and looks nice on desktop tasks or scrolling websites but I almost never get that kind of FPS in a game unless it s really old easy like UT2004 Instead I adjust settings in games so they tend to run between 50 100fps depending on how demanding the game is and where what I m doing in the game For me this strikes a nice balance between fidelity and refresh rate on my upper midrange PC This results in zero tearing smooth gameplay with low latency since vsync holds a buffer or two and that is no longer needed now latest buffer is always shown as soon as it s ready and maximizes the usage of the GPU That is to say instead of keeping 10 20 of it s capability reserved to avoid screen tears on frames that suddenly take longer to draw you can have a game that is almost always 10 20 smoother and if when a frame takes longer to draw the monitor essentially just waits until it s ready instead of showing a torn frame In fact it is recommended to set an fps limit slightly below the max refresh since VRR will still tear when FPS exceeds max refresh without vsync setting a cap just a little bit below max means that slight instabilities in frame pacing will not exceed the monitors capabilities i e with a 165hz display it is recommended to set a limit at 160 or even 150 either in the driver s control panel or in game fps limiter when available If you are worried about lower refresh rates falling below the lower limit better implementations in monitors support a feature called low frame rate compensation that holds frames for a multiple of the refresh rate range when FPS is too low i e with a range of 48 165 if the game is running at 42fps it will refresh at 84hz but show each frame twice or maybe even 126hz but show each frame thrice depends on the monitor VRR is IMO one of the more important innovations to come to PC gaming as of late because it allows gamers to take fuller advantage of their hardware and makes tuning the graphics settings easier and more personalized It is especially useful on weaker systems where every bit of performance counts and lower refresh rates where frame tears are more noticeable since they spend longer on screen The only real downside to VRR is that some oddball games are buggy or have horrible frame pacing that can freak out the display controller For example I have encountered that java minecraft specifically with my setup will fluctuate rapidly and wildly between 120 200fps which results in my display s brightness fluctuating kind of like a flicker vsync breaks it even more somehow It s a known firmware panel issue with no planned patch from the display manufacturer So my fix is to set minecraft to run uncapped but limit framerate to 480 in amd s control panel and enable amd s enhanced sync which basically lets the game run unlimited or in my case up to the limit set earlier but keeps a buffer of the last complete frame This lets it fluctuate between 300 400 fps but by keeping the last finished frame in a buffer results in no tears normally this would waste a lot of power but luckily minecraft is easy
