1j6yx4y,Is there an app we can install on my mom's iphone with her consent to remotely access it to help her find things she's lost? (Early Alzheimer),"Tl;dr:  Is there a way my mom can allow us to remotely access her iphone and help her keep track of emails, texts and conversations as her memory declines, while we try to move her closer?   
  
My mom has mild cognitive impairment due to early alzheimers, and is rapidly moving towards no longer being able to live independently.  We're working as fast as we can to get her into an assisted living facility near us, she currently lives 2hrs away.  We've been handling most of the logistics of trying to make that happen, but every once in a while she gets a wild hair and decides she can handle it on her own.  She's recently announced that one place we're on the waitlist for contacted her to set up a tour and she's convinced it means they have an opening coming up.  She's also announced that she found some alternatives in our area with immediate openings.  The thing is, she cant really give us the info we need to verify any of this.  She ""loses"" these conversations in an ""email text message thing,"" can't recall the relevant information, and cant sort technology out enough anymore inorder to effectively forward those conversations to us when she is able to find them.  

We're not going to be able to see her until next weekend, when she says she's scheduled tours that she can no longer find record of.   She's expressed a willingness to let me access her phone if I can figure out a way to do so remotely.  I figured if there was a way to remotely access her phone, tech support folks might know how. 

I hope this post doesnt violate rule 8, this would be done with her total awareness.  I assume if its feasible, we'd need her cooperation to do so anyways.  If this does violate the rules, I apologize to the mods in advance for wasting your time.

1jovtog,Please help: How can I remove my phone number from a random business profile that is not mine??,"(I wasn't allowed to post this on r/Google and was redirected here. I wasn't sure what flair to use, sorry)

I've had my current phone number for well over 20 years and recently in the past few I've gotten occasional calls asking for a gas station. It used to be very rare and I just assumed people were dialing the wrong number accidently. It has gotten more frequent however and just a few days ago, someone actually text me. They were asking a question about the gas station and I told them they had the wrong number.

They then sent me a screenshot of said gas station with the Google listing and it very much has MY phone number listed.

I live in Illinois and my phone number has and Illinois Area code. The business is in Missouri.

I just got another call this morning and someone left a voice mail complain to the business that they were over charged when they got gas, so I feel bad that people aren't actually able to contact the business properly.

I am NOT this business and I want to know how I can remove my phone number from the listing as soon as possible. I usually ignore the calls and go on with my day, but it has become more frequent and I want to put a stop to it before it gets out of control.

Thank you for the help!",18,2025-04-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jovtog/please_help_how_can_i_remove_my_phone_number_from/,17,techsupport

1j6rxqs,I took my PC to a repair shop because it wouldn‚Äôt turn on after getting hit by a soccer ball.,"They called me to say that whoever built the PC didn‚Äôt do it right and it shouldn‚Äôt have been turned on in the first place. The motherboard was digging into the PC case paint and shorting everything. Apparently I forgot to use the standoffs for the motherboard when I built this in 2017. Good thing all the parts are still in working condition.

1jirypc,Mom needs help for disabled kid‚Äôs computer,"My kid with disabilities is excited for an upcoming esports tournament at their school. ‚ÄúMarvel Rivals‚Äù was voted by the students as the game choice for the esports student tournament. Unfortunately the Steam platform causes his computer to crash whenever he tried to load it. All I could afford on a limited income was this computer from Amazon: Lenovo ThinkCentre M92p High Performance Small Factor Form Business Desktop Computer, Intel Core i5-3470 3.2GHz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD, DVD, Windows 10 Professional (Renewed)

Does anyone have anyone helpful affordable solutions I could learn from YouTube or something that I could do to get his computer not to crash so he could play in the upcoming esports tournament? He was so excited to connect with kids his age at school who play video games and participate in the esports tournament as he gets excluded a lot due to his disabilities. 

This mom would appreciate some computer tech advice. 

Edit: 

I‚Äôm overwhelmed by everyone‚Äôs advice and support. I‚Äôve tried to respond to many of the responses as I can. I understand from the comments our computer is just too old for the newer games. We aren‚Äôt able to replace the computer at this time, but from the suggestions it seems cloud gaming for the practice for, and participation in, the esports tournament is the better temporary option for us; although I learned there is drawbacks and costs associated with cloud gaming as well. But based on suggestions, I‚Äôm going to look for an Ethernet cable to connect our computer to our internet to help for cloud gaming. After getting better informed from everyone‚Äôs advice, I contacted the school and my son will be connecting with the teacher coordinating the esports tournament in hopes of participating. The kind comments and support mean a lot. ",1100,2025-03-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1jirypc/mom_needs_help_for_disabled_kids_computer/,252,buildapc

1jcgqpp,PC troubleshooting is really exhausting and is not talked about in most tutorials,"This week, I built a PC with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an RX 7900 XT on an ASUS ROG B650E-F motherboard. My last build was in 2019, and while I have a solid understanding of PC components, I haven‚Äôt kept up with recent hardware changes.

During the build, I ran into a few issues that required some deep dives into Reddit threads and PC forums to figure out.

AM5 Boot Times

When I first powered on the system, the DRAM error LED lit up. I reseated the RAM, checked for damage, and retried several times. What I didn‚Äôt realize was that AM5 motherboards take a couple of minutes to train the memory on the first boot. Since my previous system booted in under 15 seconds, I kept shutting it off too soon. This isn‚Äôt something I had seen mentioned in any PC-building guides, but it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary troubleshooting.

EXPO/XMP Profile Issues

Once I got into the BIOS, I updated it and enabled the 6000MHz EXPO profile. After restarting, I got a VRAM error. I tried lowering it to 5600MHz, but the issue persisted.

Eventually, I found the solution: a small 3-pin jumper on the motherboard labeled CPU OC Control needs to be moved one pin to the right to allow higher voltage for memory overclocking. Without this, EXPO wouldn‚Äôt work. A lot of Youtube guides use this exakt model of ASUS B650E mainboard and none of the guides mentioned this, even though others have run into the same issue. 



Troubleshooting these issues took several hours, and I wish more PC-building content covered these essentials. A lot of people run into the same problems, but finding the right solutions often requires digging through forum posts instead of mainstream guides.
