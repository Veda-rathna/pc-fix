1jq810s,Someone has control of my pc,"Someone took over my browser (I thought it was just my browser at first)

I was just sitting at my desk watching hulu with browsers open in both my monitors when suddenly someone opened a new tab and typed in a web address, which after a quick search I discovered was likely a crypto site. How would someone be able to take over my browser (they even tried to prevent me from disconnecting from the internet)? This had happened a few times when I was running chrome, so I switched to Firefox. Thinking I would be safe... I'm guessing it's on my computer, not just the browser. 

Am I due for a factory reset? Or is there a way to find the way they are getting on my pc and fix it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",298,2025-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jq810s/someone_has_control_of_my_pc/,160,techsupport
1jnnfpu,I have 10 years IT experience. My friend's PC is perplexing me,"A very good friend of mine (let's call him Tim) recently wanted a new gaming PC and instead of dealing with GPU stock and prices right now, he went prebuilt. This story involves 2 prebuilt PCs he has tried to use, both suffering from the same issue that I am out of ideas on to try and fix:

The first prebuilt was this [one](https://www.microcenter.com/product/678479/powerspec-g447-gaming-pc). The original issue is this:

* Connect Tim's 34inch Odyssey 1440p UW and his 24in basic 1080p monitor.
* Play a game such as Apex or PubG.
* After a certain amount of time (sometimes 5 mins, sometimes an hour), both monitors black screen, his CPU, GPU and case fans speed up.
* PC must be hard powered off via the case button.

After getting this with the first, Tim returns the first and now buys this [PC.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/684527/powerspec-g719-gaming-pc?ob=1) This is the current PC I have been trying to troubleshoot. We have the exact same issue. Some odd things I have noticed:

* It only does this crash when he is outputting to both displays. If he only outputs to the 1080p display, it dos not occur.
* It crashes when just his Odyssey UW is plugged in 1080p display is not (this and the point before somehow made me think the monitor was the issue even though I have never seen a display crash a computer.).
* When the crash occurs, on first boot, his GPU is disabled in device manager, only one monitor gets an output and the PC uses the Microsoft Basic Display Driver. We have to manually re-enable the GPU in device manager (this makes me thing the GPU is the culprit somehow).
* Running only one RAM stick did not result in a crash (this makes me then think RAM is somehow the culprit).
* Total power draw in AMD Adrenaline is only \~250w when gaming.

Things we have tried:

* Latest Windows and display drivers.
* Rolling back display drivers through safe mode/DDU.
* He bought an entirely different PC going from Intel/Nvidia > AMD/AMD.
* Setting AMD's XMP equivalent to manual and forcing the RAM to run at 6000 mhz.
* Setting AMD's XPM equivalent to EXPO2 since a friend mentioned typically this is more stable. After doing this step, the crash takes longer to occur. I noticed this changed RAM timings in the BIOS when I confirmed settings.
* He brought his PC to my house. It still crashes when using my cables/peripherals and outputting to my UW 1440p Alienware and 1080p secondary monitor.
* Setting the High Performance power plan.

So where my thought process is at currently:

* How can it be his Odyssey monitor causing the issues when it crashes on my displays?
* It can't be his electrical at home/cables since it also occurs at my house.
* How can it be the GPU? The chances of getting two bad GPUs are slim.
   * I am still leaning towards the GPU being an issue since it gets disabled in device manager after ever crash. I cannot find anything in event viewer.
* Could it be the RAM still? I am not too experienced yet with DDR5. Is there something else in the BIOS I should play with?
* I guess it could be the PSU? But how could he somehow also get two bad PSUs back to back? I have no way of testing it but it is a 750w, PowerSpec 80+ Gold PSU so it is above the recommended spec for the 7800xt.

I am out of ideas. While my friend wants a PC and his defeated, at this point the old Tier 1 employee in me is going nuts. Any advice is appreciated.

1jpye1u,A prankster neighbor has managed to override my Bluetooth connection to my speakers,"When I came home last Friday I thought someone had broken into my home, there were strange sounds. When I checked my home I heard they came from my speakers, gaming sounds, a woman saying ""an enemy has been slain"" repeatedly. Someone had connected their League of Legends gaming sounds to my speakers for some weird reason. 

I usually leave my home with my computer and leave the bluetooth device connected to my speakers ""free"", I never thought in a million years someone would connect to it.

The weird part is that when I disconnected the bluetooth device (a TP-link music receiver model HA100) and connected it again I connected to it but the sounds from the gaming came back, as if it automatically connected to the other device outside my home. Even though it still said ""connected"" on my computer.

After seven attempts I was able to successfully connect to it and the gaming sounds were finally gone. I was relieved for the moment and made sure to disconnect the bluetooth device anytime I left my home.

But today I was watching Netflix and all of a sudden I hear a little ""crack"" in my speakers, as if it lost its connection. A voice from my speakers yelled something indistinguishable except for the word ""penis"". This wasn't a mistake, this is some neighbors kid pranking me. 

But how the fuck did he manage to override the Bluetooth connection to my own computer while I was still connected to it?

I also notice that the light becomes blue as soon as I connect it to electricity. Has the neighbor managed to be a ""priority"" connection to it and if so, how? 

Is a solution that I go to somewhere else and connect to my computer where the neighbors device can't reach it or is there another solution?",63,2025-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jpye1u/a_prankster_neighbor_has_managed_to_override_my/,32,techsupport
1jqs0p9,GPU touched 105 degree celsius and then core permanently died.,"Basically I have a GTX 1060 6gb, the fan died, I deshrouded and added a 120mm fan.

Pc booted fine, started furmark to test the temps, then started gpuz. I was shocked to see the hotspot temp was 105 degrees. I tried to close furmark but the display went black, I switched off the pc from the mains.

Disassembled. Thermal paste looked fine, even without thermal paste the temps should not have sky rocketed that fast, so I assumed the heatsink was just not in contact. Put gpu back in and started pc but it just kept giving a beep code. Basically the core died and the gpu is not being recognized.

What I found strange was why did the fail safe not work? Why was the gpu allowed to reach such high temp, I usually have my msi afterburner set to limit temps to 75 degrees only.

I want to know if its possible for a gpu to die like this with high temp, instead of just shutting down to save itself.

Update: Appreciate all the comments here, thanks for taking ur time to help a fellow redditor out. Some comments are implying the card was already dying, this is quite possible, it was a used card that I had purchased and it looks has lasted me a long time. 

I still want to know if, in general, a gpu can shut down the pc or just itself when it crosses temps that are unsafe for the card, like a cpu does. ",45,2025-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jqs0p9/gpu_touched_105_degree_celsius_and_then_core/,23,techsupport

I've had my current phone number for well over 20 years and recently in the past few I've gotten occasional calls asking for a gas station. It used to be very rare and I just assumed people were dialing the wrong number accidently. It has gotten more frequent however and just a few days ago, someone actually text me.

They then sent me a screenshot of said gas station with the Google listing and it very much has MY phone number listed.

I live in Illinois and my phone number has and Illinois Area code. The business is in Missouri.

I just got another call this morning and someone left a voice mail complain to the business that they were over charged when they got gas, so I feel bad that people aren't actually able to contact the business properly.

I am NOT this business and I want to know how I can remove my phone number from the listing as soon as possible. I usually ignore the calls and go on with my day, but it has become more frequent and I want to put a stop to it before it gets out of control.

1jsdyrv,My father got convinced by a scammer to download an app and wanted him to grant accessibility settings (android),"He has all his bank accounts on this phone. Basically he got a call from the scammers and they convinced him to download an apk and install it, the installed app itself downloaded another app, which he did and then they asked him to grant accessibility settings, at which point, he fortunately got suspicious and hung up.

He says that he only installed the apps and did not allow accessibility settings, but I cannot trust his word 100% because he is not tech savvy. But I checked later and the app did not have accessibility turned on.

I uninstalled both the apps and deleted the main apk, but I could not find the apk of the secondary file (I'm not sure whether if an app is installed through another app, an apk is downloaded at all). I did although download the main apk again once and installed the app just to show my father the screens so that he could tell me for sure whether he gave it accessibility access. Of course, I deleted both the apps again.

I was wondering:

1. Is there a way to check if any malware is still installed on his phone and if it is using the accessibility settings?
2. What can the scammers do if he did grant accessibility access?
3. What would ideally be the next steps? Should I factory reset after backing up data. Will that neutralize any risks 100%?

1joe8xe,"Random GPU Crashes, Event 14, 153, LiveKernelEvent 141","**Hey everyone,**

Just made an account hoping to finally solve a tech issue I've been wrestling with for several months, it's been truly frustrating.

Back in December, my computer started behaving erratically, experiencing random **LiveKernelEvent 141** errors leading to complete crashes. Each crash forced either a manual reboot or resulted in the system rebooting itself. Resetting graphics drivers didn’t help; the screen would remain black until a reboot. Reliability history was filled with continuous **Event 141 reports.**

Oddly, the issue subsided after about a week. Soon after, I built a completely new system, reusing only my GPU (**RTX 4090**) and PSU (**Corsair RMX 1000**). Everything ran smoothly for about a month before the exact same problem returned. Now it’s even more unpredictable, occurring randomly, from playing RimWorld to simply watching YouTube. Strangely, it never crashes during intensive games, which is puzzling.

Thinking the GPU was the culprit, I sent the RTX 4090 for an RMA. In the meantime, I installed my old RTX 3080, assuming this would resolve the issue, but the crashes continue, so the GPU isn’t to blame.

***Current error events include:***

* **Event ID 14 (nvlddmkm)**
* **Event ID 153 (nvlddmkm), repeated often, with messages such as:**
* **Resetting TDR**
* **Reset TDR**
* **Restarting TDR**
* **LiveKernelEvent 141**

***Troubleshooting steps already attempted:***

* **Reseated all components.**
* **Tested with different GPUs.**
* **Removed CPU overclocks and EXPO (previously stable for 1.5 years).**
* **Swapped power cables for CPU and GPU.**
* **Replaced storage drives.**
* **Ran standard checks (chkdsk, sfc /scannow).**
* **Cleaned GPU drivers with DDU over 10 times, reinstalling fresh drivers each time.**
* **Fully reinstalled Windows twice.**
* **Reset BIOS, drivers, and control panel settings to defaults.**
* **Various other minor troubleshooting steps.**

At this point, I suspect the PSU might be the issue, but no other components show any sign of failure. I'm at a complete loss, so any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. I'm probably overlooking something or just room temperature IQ.

* **Motherboard:** AORUS X870E Pro Ice
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D
* **CPU Cooler:** Corsair Nautilus 360mm AIO
* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3080 *(temporary)*
* *Note: RTX 4090 is currently RMA’d, already shipped*
* **RAM:** 64GB DDR5 5600 MT/s – Crucial Pro
* **Storage:** 2 × 2TB Kingston FURY Renegade NVMe SSDs

1jqg56b,New Windows 11 computer does not work with ANY game controller (but works with every other USB device),"I recently built a new Windows 11 PC, and I'm having a rather infuriating issue where every single USB device that I plug into the computer works fine *except* for any sort of game controller (Xbox One, DualShock 3, DualShock 4, and Switch Pro controllers). These devices do not work at all; Windows does not seem to recognize them or acknowledge that they were inserted into the machine at all. I *believe* that they might be run in ""power"" mode, since the controllers begin charging when plugged in, but I can't get them to work no matter what I do.

First, some background. My new machine has the following specs:

* Operating System: Windows 11 Pro
* OS Version: 24H2
* OS build: 26100.3476
* Motherboard: [ASRock X870E Taichi Lite](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X870E%20Taichi%20Lite/index.asp)
* Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8-Core Processor

And my old machine has the following specs:

* Operating System: Windows 10 Pro
* OS Version: 22H2
* OS build: 10.0.19045 Build 19045
* Motherboard: MSI Z370 SLI PLUS (MS-7B46)
* Processor: Intel Core i7-8700K

I have plugged numerous devices into my new computer, and almost everything works, including:

* A SanDisk flash drive
* An external hard drive
* Multiple different keyboards and mice
* An iPhone 15 Pro and a Samsung Galaxy S22
* [A Loopy 3DS capture card](https://3dscapture.com/)
* [An HDMI capture card](https://www.genkithings.com/products/shadowcast-2-pro)

And everything worked fine. I did extremely exhaustive testing where I tried plugging these into *every* single port on the computer, and they all worked as you would expect. For the various phones, I connected them via both a USB-A to USB-C and a USB-C to USB-C cable, and they worked fine either way. One thing we can say for certain is that the USB ports on this new computer broadly work.

However, when I plug in any of the following controllers:

* Xbox One Controller
* DualShock 3
* DualShock 4
* Switch Pro Controller

Nothing happens. Windows doesn't even seem to recognize that I've plugged in a controller. It doesn't make a popup appear, they don't appear in the Device Manager, every application acts like there are no controllers connected, etc. As I stated before, the rechargeable controllers *do* start charging when I plug them in, but that's it. And like with the other USB devices, I tried them in *every* single USB port, and for the Switch Pro Controller, I even tried both a USB-A to USB-C and a USB-C to USB-C cable. Nothing I tried worked at all, despite the fact that the *exact* same controllers with the *exact* same cables worked fine on my old machine.

I did some digging around online, and some people suggested reinstalling the drivers from Device Manager, but as I said before, *none* of these controllers show up in the Device Manager. The Xbox One Controller doesn't show up in the Xbox Accessories app either, mind you. I even installed the Windows SDK to use [USBView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview), but the controllers don't show up there either.

Someone else suggested (and unfortunately, I can't find the link again, sorry) that it could be fixed by using System -> Recovery -> Fix Problems using Windows Update. I tried doing that, but it made no difference. I then started digging around in the BIOS to see if any of the options might make a difference. I went to Advanced -> USB Configuration, and the only thing I saw option that I saw that seemed relevant is ""XHCI Hand-off,"" which defaulted to ""Enabled""; disabling it made no difference. I also remember enabling EXPO on my RAM before I ever plugged in a controller, so I disabled it and nothing changed. I also made sure that I had the latest BIOS installed, I installed all the chipset drivers and everything else on my motherboard's website, etc., but I actually had already done this *before* I ever plugged in a controller, so it made no difference.

Getting desperate, I wondered if there was some way of proving that it's Windows' fault and not the computer's. I decided to boot Ubuntu via a USB stick just to see if it would recognize my controllers. It didn't recognize my Xbox One controller, but it recognized everything else, and I could even use the DualShock 4's touchpad to move the mouse around. I ran `lsusb` while the controllers were connected so you can clearly see that the system is recognizing them; here's the output for the [DualShock 3](https://pastebin.com/99yTfRun), [DualShock 4](https://pastebin.com/edPj3W3q), and [Switch Pro Controller](https://pastebin.com/4iu0kWs8).

At this point, I'm truly unsure as to how to fix this. The controllers *definitely* work, because I can plug them into the old computer and use them just fine. The USB ports on my new computer *definitely* work, because I can plug in anything that *isn't* a controller into them and they'll work perfectly. And the experiment with Ubuntu shows that even the combination of these controllers with this computer *should* work in theory. However, something is completely preventing them from working on Windows 11, and I have no idea how to go about fixing that.

Has anyone seen something like this before? Even if you haven't, do you have any ideas on how to fix this? One thing I was thinking of doing is reinstalling Windows 11, just to see if that made any sort of difference, but I'm not sure if it will. I could also try downgrading to 23H2 too, but Microsoft is dropping support for that version by the end of the year, so even if that *does* solve the issue, it's a temporary fix at best. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated here, as I am completely out of ideas.",6,2025-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jqg56b/new_windows_11_computer_does_not_work_with_any/,2,techsupport
1jrvyuv,Security solutions for the tech-illiterate,"Full disclosure, I also posted this in the antivirus community

Hi All

I work for a US-based system integrator/retailer that performs IT, assembly, and repair services for both businesses and walk-in customers. 
Many of our walk-ins are people who are tech-illiterate and have been taken advantage of (mostly by social engineering, but also occasionally by things like ransomware and infostealers) and it breaks my heart.
Today, an elderly gentleman came in who was the victim of a ransomware attack. He lost many pictures of his late wife as well as some childhood photos of his two kids. We did our best to check for restore points or backups, but we were unable to recover the data.
In addition to all that, Im also setting up a new laptop for my mom to use as her daily. Shes pretty tech illiterate, and so Im looking for things I can do to help her stay safe on her computer.

When I looked on reddit for recommendations on solutions, many people just gave answers like ""be smart and use windows defender"" which is pretty terrible advice to give to an elderly person who barely knows what a computer is, or to my mom (because shed probably smack the hell out of me).

On top of uBlock Origin/Lite, Im looking for recommendations on software that I can use both personally and at work.
As far as antiviruses go:
- Personal one can be paid or free. Needs to have good behavioral dtc. Ideally it would be lightweight (battery life is important), but shes got 24gb DDR5 and a new Ryzen AI 9 so its not a huge issue if it needs some extra juice.
- Work one should be free. Lightweight would be great as many walk-ins have older machines.

If anyone has any ideas on what can be done by us more tech-savvy folks to help keep tech-illiterate people safe on the internet please let me know, im open to all suggestions.",5,2025-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jrvyuv/security_solutions_for_the_techilliterate/,7,techsupport

# Soft Reset (Power Cycle) – Best for Minor Glitches

1. **Turn off** the TV using the remote.
2. **Unplug** the power cord from the outlet.
3. **Wait 60 seconds** (drains residual power).
4. **Plug it back in** and turn it on.

  
I did do a soft reset.  Did not work.   I had to do #5 from the article to get it to work again.  It was quite helpful

1jpt92n,Windows 11 Audio Crackling & Popping,"I have been experiencing a very annoying crackling/popping sound for a while. **I hear it especially when adjusting the volume and skipping songs.** I recently got IEMs, which are far more detailed and have a vastly better soundstage. I'm not sure if I only recently noticed this issue because of them, but I didn't notice any popping sound before.

The problem is that, after hearing it once, I just can't unhear it anymore—it's practically always there. It happens whenever a sound stops playing and a new one begins. It doesn't persist beyond that, but if another track starts, I hear the pop again.

I have tested this with two different IEMs (both via 3.5mm and a USB DAC/AMP), a wireless 2.4 GHz gaming headset (also tested wired via 3.5mm), and a pair of Bluetooth earbuds. I tried all of these across four different PCs (two laptops and two desktops). The issue is the same with every single combination, so I'm confident it's not my setup. One of the four systems is a fresh install, so third-party software isn't the cause. Additionally, I know the headphones aren't the issue, as they work perfectly fine on Android devices.

So far, I have tried:

1. Testing all bit-depth and frequency combinations in Windows sound settings
2. Disabling all audio enhancements and unnecessary Windows sound settings
3. Turning off PCI Express Link State Power Management in the Power Plan
4. Using both front and back ports for wired connections
5. Setting different sound devices as default in playback settings
6. Updating drivers and switching to the generic High Definition Audio device drivers, as suggested in some YouTube videos
7. Uninstalling and reinstalling drivers and sound devices
8. Trying multiple players such as VLC, Groove Music on Windows, YouTube, etc.

Please see if you can reproduce the issue I'm having by hyperfocusing on the sound while adjusting the volume between 0–20% and skipping songs. If I can confirm that this is simply a Windows issue, I'm ready to let it go. It's the not knowing that bothers me.",5,2025-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jpt92n/windows_11_audio_crackling_popping/,8,techsupport
1jpjra6,[UPDATED] Accidentally Formatted HDD D Drive – 600GB of Critical Data Lost – Any Hope? Update: My Previous Post Mistakenly Said SSD – It’s Actually an HDD,"The Full Mess I’m In:

My PC was stuck in a boot loop on Windows 10.

I decided to format my C drive and install Windows 11 on it.

C drive and D drive are on separate hard drives.

I have a backup of my C drive (so that’s safe).

But after installing Windows 11, the boot loop issue continued.

While trying to fix it, I accidentally formatted my D drive (600GB of critical data).

Now, I’m stuck with a broken system AND lost data.


----------

What I’ve Tried So Far:

Booted Linux Mint (Live USB) to attempt recovery.

TestDisk detects the lost data but struggles to recover it.

Photorec was an option, but my external HDD won’t connect in Linux, so I can’t store recovered files.

I used the drive in Live Linux for 2-3 hours—worried if this affected data integrity.

Still stuck in a Windows 11 boot loop.

------

My Next Steps (Need Advice!):

Get an SSD-to-USB adapter to access the drive externally.

Disable TRIM (though HDDs don’t have TRIM, is there anything else I should disable?)

Try DiskDrill (or any better recommendation?).

Fix the Windows 11 boot loop once the data situation is handled.



---

I Need Expert Help – Any Hope Left?

I’ve been working on this for two days straight, no sleep, mentally wrecked. I live in a rural area, so I can’t easily go to a data recovery center.

This is a complex case—if you need more details, just ask. I’ll provide whatever info you need.

Would love to hear any success stories, advanced recovery methods, or expert advice.

Thanks in advance—I really need guidance.

{ Update 2 . I have removed the hard drive from the system. The SSD is still on, so I guess we can focus on running my windows and stopping this booting problem. As it's not booting, it's just opening. The circle is going round and round and restarting. }

{ Update 3 : successfully was able to reinstall windows and now I am restoring data of C derive which I already have as backup } ",6,2025-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jpjra6/updated_accidentally_formatted_hdd_d_drive_600gb/,39,techsupport
1jpa37n,Disabling Firewall allows me to download things?,"FINAL EDIT: I ended up factory resetting my PC. There is no fix, that I know of, because my problem was deeply rooted. Thank you all for the help!

EDIT: I am using the built-in Windows Firewall. My firewall, for some reason, works in a very specific way where I have to disable it to actually be able to download things. To my knowledge, Firewalls don't work that way. But I can be wrong.

EDIT 2: When I turn off my Windows Defender Firewall (Public), everything works as normal. But when I turn it on, I cannot access things again.

EDIT 3: I have tried certain commands that ""theDeadestCow"" mentioned below. The last one, `netsh advfirewall reset` , fixes it but the moment I restart my PC the problem is back and I am back to square one.

EDIT 4: Could it be that the Group Policy, whatever it's called, is restricting me? Is there a way I can reset that?

EDIT 4.5: It appears it isn't GPO, I managed to check it out thanks to ""*gpresult /Z > C:\\gp\_report.txt && notepad C:\\gp\_report.txt*"". There was no indication of it.

EDIT 5: Didn't think I'd have to make this many edits, but I will be checking the Event Viewer, to see what the Firewall is doing after I restart it and such. Because something is corrupted, it's a deeper issue most likely.

EDIT 6:  **Changed network from Public to Private** (since Public networks have stricter firewall rules).  
 **Manually allowed applications** (Epic Games, browsers) through Windows Defender Firewall.  
 **Disabled and re-enabled Windows Defender Firewall** to see if settings persisted. 

Created a **batch script** to run `netsh advfirewall reset` on startup via **Task Scheduler**.

Checked Registry Settings

**Checked Windows Defender Firewall logs** to see what was being blocked.

Checked **Event Viewer** logs under **Security** for firewall rule modifications.

Still no fix. I will keep trying but this is leading to a full PC reset, since this is deep issue. Will update if I end up factory resetting my PC.

As the title says, disabling my Firewall ALLOWS me to download things such as Epic Games launcher, etc. Yes, I did allow my browser through Firewall, I even did multiple CMD commands, to reset my network, firewall rules, reset firewall itself, EVERYTHING. But to no AVAIL. I go and turn off my firewall, telling myself ""nah watch this work lol"", and BEHOLD: IT FUCKING WORKS. Does anyone have a solution to this? Why is it allowing me to download files when I disable my FIrewall? Despite allowing it through my Firewall? I did swap out my HDD for my SSD, and I formated my HDD and everything before doing so. Could it be that my PC remembers old Firewall rules? But even then, I reset them, yet it doesn't work UNLESS I turn off my Firewall? I have NEVER encountered this. Any tips? Advice? Possibly solutions? Thanks in advance!",4,2025-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jpa37n/disabling_firewall_allows_me_to_download_things/,43,techsupport

1jrabug,My internet randomly disconnects for 5-10 seconds at random times and DC's me from any online gaming activity,"Hey everyone,

As the title says, I've been having internet issues and have come here as a somewhat last resort for help. I have pretty decent internet speeds, and when I moved out, I stayed with the same internet brand as my parents as we got a deal; which was MATE. My router is an asus rt-ac86u. I also live in Australia if that matters.

Some information about what happens:  
My voice will drop out of discord for 5-10 seconds at max  
any online game will temporary disconnect me, and then it always forces me to leave, often resulting in me having to fully close the game and relaunch it to reconnect to servers

Some things I have tried:  
1. I have used my PC, laptop, and phone on both 5Ghz, 2.4Ghz, and dual band. All have the same issue  
2. I have tried ethernet and wifi and there is no difference  
3. I have tried using Win+R and pinging to both my IP and [google.com](http://google.com), which will normally give a reply, but every now and then, for 5-10 seconds will say ""request timed out"" before going back to usual  
4. I have connected to each UNI-D port from my modem (although I know you're only meant to do 1 or 2)  
5. I contacted my parents who also seem to have the same issue. They stated that the NBN people came to try and fix it, but because it's intermittent and not constant, they couldn't find a problem and wouldn't come out to fix it. They claim it's a problem with the equipment, even though I also get the same problem and live 3 hours away in a major city.

I guess these are the questions I have:  
1. Is there anything else I should try to get logs or attempt to fix it on my own without getting the internet company involved (I have access to router information and settings if there might be something there)?  
2. If not, what seems to be causing the issue, because I think this sounds like an issue with the company we get internet from, but I could be mistaken as I'm not an expert in this field  
3. any other general tips or suggestions for minimising the affect, and if I can't fix it on my own, would there be a way to maybe lower the overall speed of my internet or something in order to not disconnect for the random few seconds?

Until it's not, it'll boot back to windows and work for a bit until a crash and after the crash a reset returns to the same screen with it unplugged.

When I run certain games, and only certain games, I get a strange buzzing noise that comes through my headphones even with my PC muted. 

The last time I tested one of these games, upon closing out I had several freezes that lasted as long as 15 to 20 seconds each. These freezes were accompanied with some minor visual artifacting. Eventually it went away and stopped, and I was able to restart my PC and clear the CMOS.

I checked to make sure that my surge protector is plugged into a fully grounded socket, it is. 
I then ran a long GPU and CPU stress test, which did not trigger the buzzing noise and did not indicate any problems. 

When I launch certain games the buzzing sound still persists.

Heat levels seem fine, I am monitoring CPU heat, GPU heat, GPU, hotspot and memory heat, etc. 
All fans appear to be working perfectly fine. 
All voltages seem to be fine, as far as I can tell.

I have recently installed the following WiFi antenna into one of my PCIe slots: ""SYONCON WiFi 6E AXE5400 PCIe WLAN Card for PC Intel AX210 Chipset"". After connecting this device, I have experienced that every time I start a game that requires moderate GPU power (any modern game) my OS crashes or my PC restarts. The games crash mostly during the initial loading screen, at that time my GPU temperature is around 50°C (122 F) to 60°C (140 F) and the fans are spinning.

Additionally, my internet speed is 250Mbps but I notice that **sometimes** my WiFi antenna struggles to provide more than 25Mbps, so there seems to be some kind of bottlenck.

I have done the following tests and the crashes only occur under the same condition (execute a modern game):

\- Install all my data in a SATA SSD vs M2 slot SSD

\- Use Windows 11 vs Debian bookworm

\- Install the latest NVIDIA drivers vs drivers from August 2024 (when this problem didn't occur)

The problem only goes away when I remove the WiFi antenna from the PCIe slot.

This is my hardware:

\- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X

\- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060

\- RAM: 2x8GB DDR4 DRAM

\- 1TB SSD

\- MOBO: AMD B450M DS3H (rev. 1.x)

1js2zwl,One of my monitors has blurry or jagged text. I have tried practically every fix I can find.,"So, my monitor is the ASUS VG258Q, i bought this quite some time ago and up until maybe 4 months ago it has been a flawlessly wonderful monitor to use.

Now, to break down what I mean by ""jagged/blurry text"", it's like the monitors display is cutting off pixels here and there when it comes to texts, like imagine the text you're reading right now has one line of pixel not really rendering in clearly. For me, that's the bottom row of that text. It's hard to explain and I sound like i'm tripping, so i apologise.

I have an extensive background in IT, I had this issue a while ago and I cannot remember how the hell I fixed it. I have tried every single fix i could find. Literally dozens of forums, hundreds of posts, I have counted about... 30 odd reinstalls of drivers, rollbacks, clear-text changes and whatnot and absolutely nothing has changed.

The monitor itself still works fine, in terms of gaming, its fine, my graphics card (1080) shows no sign of deteriotation and i frequently update drivers.

I have gone as far as switching out HDMI cables with about 6 or 7 others that i have borrowed or found around my place. 

I don't want to buy a new monitor, i cannot afford expenses like that these days, so i'm kind of hoping you guys can help out?

So, here's the conclusion for this post, so it's a bit tidy.

**Problem**

Blurry text that occurs in parts of the screen, typically to top right quarter of the screen

Blurry in this case means jagged and maybe cut off pixels if that makes sense? 

**Solutions I've tried**

- Syncing resolution and frame rate via windows settings (duh, simple stuff)

- Cleartext (numerous times)

- Nvidia driver reinstallation/reroll/updates (numerous times)

- Resolution scaling (minimal difference, and I never touched that setting in the first place so don't know why its playing up now)

- Changed HDMI ports and cables half a dozen times, no bueno

- Screamed at it into submission (nope)

1js1s0b,Monitor Randomly goes black and fans go crazy.,"Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660

Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core

RAM: 32GB

OS: W10

For a good while now, I've been having issues with my pc where I could be doing ANYTHING, playing a game, watching youtube, or just listening to music and all of a sudden the screen goes black, fans go crazy and sometimes the audio can be heard for a little while, sometimes it stops right away, my mouse and keyboard are still on however. Regardless of which, I still need to force my pc to shut down because I have no other options. 

  
I have tried several things from checking for corrupted files, new RAMs, updated drivers, removed and RE-installed drivers and still no success. It will work just fine for like 2 days and then go back to the same issue. Through all this I've always had a feelign that it was either the RAM or the GPU (I'm by no means a computer expert but I remember a little bit from what I was taught in school lol). Considering how new RAMs didn't do the trick, I guess I'm back to guessing but I wanted to see if anyone out there has experienced this before and has found a solution that didn't just work for a month and then went back to the same thing?",3,2025-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1js1s0b/monitor_randomly_goes_black_and_fans_go_crazy/,2,techsupport
1jrus99,Consistent memory_management BSOD errors.,"My computer has been having these BSOD crashes for a while. I get the memory_management error, a kernel security error, and another one that isn't as often that I can't immediately remember. I've tried to remove drives, I've done a full windows reinstall multiple times at this point, and I'm not sure what else to try. I've looked up the errors and have tried all of the chkdsk and scannow commands and whatnot but those don't fully fix the issue. Sometimes when I restart my pc it says it's checking the C: drive, but I've removed the initial drive it started on and it's done it on the two other drives that I insralled windows to when I did the clean reinstall.

Edit: PFN_LIST_CORRUPT is the other BSOD error i couldn't remember. It happened again.

1jredrm,Please Help Me.,"My PC had a problem where the screen was black, and only my mouse cursor was visible. I tried Ctrl + Alt + Del and other key combinations, but nothing happened. So, I held the power button for 3 seconds to restart the PC, and it worked. I was able to use it normally yesterday.

However, today, when I turned on the PC, the same issue happened again. I did the same restart method, and it worked. Then, I searched for a permanent solution and found that uninstalling the graphics driver, restarting the PC, and then reinstalling it from the manufacturer's website or Windows Update could help.

But now, my PC is stuck on the AORUS logo screen and won’t move forward. I tried restarting with the power button, but it didn’t work.

Any solution? I’d really appreciate the help!",3,2025-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jredrm/please_help_me/,7,techsupport

1jr36tg,My External HDD stopped showing up on my PC. What happened and what next steps should I take?,"**How I Found Out**: I used “Search Everything” to find a file. File was on my external drive connected to my PC (**Windows 10**)

It was freezing.  Eventually got it to close. Opened a folder and tried to access it that way. It was also freezing. Force closing caused explorer.exe to crash.

I tried to restart my PC, it said something about overheating. I decided to turn it off and wait a bit. I turned it back on and I don’t see my external hard drive (**Seagate 5TB Portable HDD STGX5000400**).

Looked so far and considered getting a SATA to USB cable or something like a External HDD dock that can connect to my PC as a last resort.

**Physical**

* I don’t see hear any weird noises
* It wasn’t dropped
* The power light is on

**Digital**

* I don’t see it at Disk Management; the rare times it does appear it doesn’t show much outside of “4000~mb” or something
* I see it on Device Manager, no error code. It says it’s healthy.
* If it does appear on “This PC” which is sometimes, it shows up as “Local Disk (E:)” with just the name and icon, no bar or storage size
* It seems like it locks up the PC whenever I try to restart or boot my computer and works when I unplug it

**Things I tried**

* I tried to connect to my laptop, but I don’t see it either
* I tried to connect to other USB ports on my computer and laptop; even removed some powered devices like my ring light, webcam, and Streamdeck
* I tried to use a different cable (from the same company too, different smaller drive)
* Uninstalling the device on Device Manager and replugging it in",3,2025-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jr36tg/my_external_hdd_stopped_showing_up_on_my_pc_what/,3,techsupport
1jr1wex,Bought a Nokia Laptop in 2023 – Now I Regret It. Need Suggestions.,"
Hey everyone,
Back in 2023, I bought a Nokia PureBook S14 laptop (Model: NKi511TL85S21090180) from Flipkart for around ₹30K. It was a budget deal, and I went for it. The laptop is made in China.

After a year, I accidentally spilled water on the keyboard, and a few keys stopped working. I took it to almost every laptop repair shop in Varanasi, but no one could fix it. Most shopkeepers were even surprised that Nokia made laptops! They all said the parts aren't available.

Since then, I’ve been using an external keyboard to manage things.

But recently, on March 20, 2025, the charger stopped working too. I again went to several stores, but couldn’t find a compatible charger. Apparently, Nokia uses a different type of connector pin, and it's really hard to find a replacement. Even online, I couldn’t find the exact charger.

Now I’m seriously worried. If any other part breaks in the future, how will I get it repaired?

I know I made a mistake buying a brand with low support, but now that I already have it, what can I do? Please suggest any possible solutions. Has anyone else faced this with Nokia laptops?

Thanks in advance.",3,2025-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jr1wex/bought_a_nokia_laptop_in_2023_now_i_regret_it/,2,techsupport

1jnbuhx,Help me pick the best GPU out of the 3.,"I am having issues picking between the RTX 4060, the Radeon RX 7600 XT and the Intel Arc B580, all of them are within my budget of \~€300. I will be pairing it with an 8700k and a motherboard that supports resizable BAR (I will of course upgrade the CPU and the motherboard in the future to prevent bottle-necking). 



\## Pros and Cons for the three are:

\- The RTX 4060 supports DLSS and DLSS FrameGen and is the most power efficient out of the 3 with only 115W TDP, but sadly only has 8gb of VRAM.

\- The RX 7600 XT has the most VRAM out of the three with 16gb, but i will be missing out on some newer tech from AMD like FSR 4, has a 190W TDP, and is the most expensive out of the three for me.

\- The Arc B580 is the cheapest out of the three, has 12gb of VRAM is quite a performer, but it also consumes the same 190W as the Radeon, i will miss out on newer tech from both AMD and Nvidia and the driver support is the least mature of the three.

Switching RAM back and forth (each stick tried on each slot separately) didnt change anything. Unplugged all power cables and connected them again. Didnt help.

Then i removed the gtx. After that NOTHING happens when i press the power button. NOT EVEN THE FANS. Even when reconnecting the GTX, where it did run the fans before, utter silence. No fans, no lights, no noise.

1jpefil,Is it worth upgrading from RTX 2070 Super?,"Hi, I've been thinking about upgrading my gpu, I've had it since I got my pc (end of 2019) and its an amazing card but it somewhat struggles nowadays, to be honest I can tell if its due to poorly optimised games (I play a lot of cities skylines 2 and microsoft flight sim) or if my 2070 super just isn't good enough anymore, or if my cpu may be the problem. I upgraded my cpu, motherboard and ram last year so I hope what I have currently is good enough but I was thinking with how bad the second hand market is right now, in Australia at least 5070ti's are coming down in retail price to about 200usd+ the usual msrp, which is still bad but generally you'll never get a clear conversion between us and aus prices.

So would it be worth upgrading my gpu to something worth splashing out a lot on? I've been thinking about the 9070xt but its completely scalped here.

My current specs are msi b760, i7-12700f, 32gb ddr4 3200mhz, rtx 2070 super, 2tb of m.2, 1tb of ssd (main os) and 2tb of hdd, 750w power supply. Thanks! ",16,2025-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1jpefil/is_it_worth_upgrading_from_rtx_2070_super/,53,buildapc
1jrl909,"Thinking of upgrading my 11 year-old CPU, PSU in preparation for a GPU upgrade. Is that the right approach?","Hey y'all, so I've had my PC for about 11 years now and the only thing I've upgraded over the years is from a 750 card to a 1060 when I wanted to play Assassin's Creed lol. I've been wanting to upgrade my GPU so I can play titles like Cyberpunk, Hogwarts, and Black Myth Wukong. I don't mind not having the maxed out graphics, but my 1060 card cannot even handle the lowest res right now (the last playable game on the lowest settings was Jedi Fallen Order)

Now, I don't have to do this right away, since I mainly just play DotA and it runs fine. But I do want to see if y'all could help me with some ideas/pointers for me of where to start as I look to slowly upgrade my dinosaur of a PC.

I'm thinking of going in the order of: PSU - CPU - Motherboard - GPU. Maybe in order or together, but the GPU definitely goes last. Is that a good approach? Thanks!

Another thought is just try to find a 3060 GPU or something in the 3000s (I see their range is current in the $500s and below?) and keep everything as-is. That should be decent enough of up grade, or is it not worth it and I should try to get one of the newer GPUs?

1jpwi1h,Best Air Coolers for 9950x3D & 9800x3D? (Help finishing new build),"Hey Everyone,

Not a big fan of AiO's - mostly because the reason I had to make a new PC was due to a AiO leak :/... I got really lucky with being able to casually walk in and get parts.

Can someone please recommend the top 3 choices for the 9950x3d & 9800x3d?

**Current New Build is:**  
**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 9950x3D  
**GPU:** MSI SHADOW 3X OC GeForce RTX 5080 16GB  
**Motherboard:** Asus ROG STRIX B850-F GAMING WIFI ATX AM5  
**RAM:** G.Skill DDR5 Trident Z5 Neo RGB 64GB (2 x 32GB) 6000MHz CL30 1.40V  
**Power Supply:** Asus ROG STRIX 1200P Gaming 1200 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply

The PC Case is the Asus ProArt PA602 Wood Edition ATX Mid Tower Case.

So far from research I'm seeing alot of recommendations for:  
(1) → Noctua NH-D15 G2 91.58 CFM CPU Cooler  
(2) → be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 5 air CPU Cooler  
(3) → Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE CPU Cooler  
(4) → Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO CPU Cooler

I'm kinda going for a Darker Wood/Metal/Glass look with coffee like contrast which is why I was pivoting towards the Noctua. I don't mind something stainless steel or even copper color/gold if possible but temperature/thermals are big.

Workload is mostly Architecture & Engineering + Renders with 4k Gaming in mind.

Could you guys please help me out with the CPU - Air Cooler recommendations?",8,2025-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1jpwi1h/best_air_coolers_for_9950x3d_9800x3d_help/,48,buildapc

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

Hey guys, it's my first PC build... I'm pretty sure everything has been plugged right, yet nothing happens when I turn the case power on. 
I tried a method to check if the PSU is dead (with a clip between the 16th & 17th) and it works fine. 

I did hesitate a lot with the wiring of the case front panel, but after a lot of research I don't see any other spot to plug it in. 

I'd be very grateful if someone could either help me identify what I might have done wrong, or if nothing is apparent, some troubleshooting and/or next steps.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Replace this text with your answer.

I replugged and checked all connectors, did the PSU test, checked several power sources. When connecting a USB docker to the front panel, it lights up, hence my belief it is a front panel connection problem.

1jol4o6,AIDA64's stress test is failing -- should I be worried?,"I just built a system with defaults for everything except the DDR5-6000 memory. MSI Edge 870e wifi 7 mobo, 9800x3d, 64GB Gskill, crucial pci5 nvme 2 TB.

The system seems to run just fine. I've run OCCT's stress tests with no issues. OS has not crashed, stuff is loading just fine. Haven't installed my GPU card yet, so no GPU stress yet.

In preparation for doing some curve optimization, I ran AIDA64 (from MSI.)

This test will fail if I check all 4 stress tests (CPU, FPU, cache, memory.)

None of the tests fail if run alone (at least not in the first 10 minutes.) Quickest failure is FPU + cache, typically less than a couple of minutes.

**Should I be worried? Return the CPU (9800x3d)? Run other tests and if none fail ignore AIDA64's results?**

Thanks.

\-------------------------------

**ISSUE RESOLVED.**

Yes, I should be worried and it's important to fix the issue. The problem turned out to be I picked the wrong memory overclocking profile (*not* EXPO.) When I switched to EXPO, stability test passed (ran it for 25 minutes.) Oh, I guess I could start playing with curve optimization now..... *hmmmm.* I was wondering about the FPU stress test getting my CPU to 94C and 135 watts power draw. Maybe CO will cut the max power. Worth trying now that I have a stable base to start with.

CO at -20 isn't stable, but -10 is. And that drops the CPU max temp during the FPU stress test to 92C. Good enough, time to wrap this up.

Build is utilizing this [combo deal](https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4771586) on Newegg to get a 9070XT at a decent price.

Last time I put together a PC it was in 2015. i7-4770k + R9 290 (later updated to a GTX 1080). Now that I finally have some disposable income and I'm noticing the old girl starting to chug on modern releases, I'm looking to get something that will hopefully last the same period of time. I assembled this by looking up the part list of an acer prebuilt and then trying to optimize from there, but I'm sure there's some stuff that I'm missing. Thanks for reading.

1jqg40l,Help. My GPU is thermally crazy,"A few months ago my PC started to sound really loudly while playing some games.

The pattern in most games is this: Fans act fine for a couple of minutes (\~2000rpm), then 4-8 seconds of massive noise (4000rpm!!) and then repeat again.

After using CPUID HWMonitor I realised it was all due to my GPU (RTX3070) Hot spot exceeding 100ºC, so the noise came from the GPU fans activating what I think is the emergency mode to cool itself (?).

This problem doesn't appear randomly in some games. In fact, now that i'm playing Baldur's Gate 3, it only appears when I open the character editor to level up my companions. It's weird, because Hot Spot is at 66ºC until I open the character editor. Then it reaches 100ºC in just 10 seconds and fans start to sound loud af.

I have two screens and I play BG3 in maximized window. When I click in another window on my second monitor (so now BG3 is running in the background), the game doesn't minimize, but the Hot Spot temperature suddenly drops from 105.6ºC to 66ºC in just 5-6 seconds. If i run BG3 in the foreground again, the temperature rises again as fast as it dropped.

This behavior made me think the problem could be related to GPU drivers so I updated them. Now my GPU Hot Spot takes a minute to reach 100ºC instead of a few seconds, but the problem persists.  


If it may help, my GPU is 2 years old and I believe this problem to have appeared at some point after playing VR games (Half Life Alyx) with Meta Quest 3 for the first time. My PC wasn't able to run HLA very smoothly and it was usual for me to resart the game after loading screens. Maybe it affected my GPU performance?",5,2025-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1jqg40l/help_my_gpu_is_thermally_crazy/,7,buildapc

Temperatures of the whole system are perfect, ran tests for every part of the pc and they all passed with flying colors. what can the reason of these micro stutters be its driving me insane, had an older pc and never had any singular stutter on it since i have got it.

Here are some examples of the micro stutters:

1jomhsj,"I'm a 3d animator upgrading from an  i7-3770, rate my new build","Will try my best to keep this simple!

I’m an extremely light gamer; I dont play AAA games, and only play multiplayer games because I prefer spending time with other people and not alone. The most advanced games I play right now are TF2 and REPO lmao. If my pc ever struggles, I just turn down the graphics. That said, with a new PC, I wouldn’t mind being able to push the graphics up. Not to the max, but enough for me to be like “Oh this is a nice change.”

I’m also an editor (1080p footage) that uses Davinci Resolve, but my PC’s performance in that program is already pretty good. I don’t do complex operations though, I just cut footage together and use some basic text/camera effects.  Rough estimate is that for 1 hour of work, I only have a total of 15 seconds of lag.

Important part: I’m a 3D animator who uses Blender (which has a lot of focus on single-core performance).  My main art style is non-photorealistic (NPR); more specifically, it’s anime-styled. It’s not visually complex, I just straight-up make Genshin Impact animations.

My current PC's a hand-me-down from my brother, I had it for atleast 5 years and it does pretty much everything I need it to do, but it’s getting old (CPU fan in particular is failing, it just stopped spinning for a second as I typed this lmao), and I want to try doing some more advanced Blender stuff that my current setup’s too weak to do, so I'd like some thoughts on my new setup I planned up over the last week. Also Win10 is ending later this year, so may as well buy Win11 with my new PC.

Here’s my current specs:

**CPU**: i7-3770 @ 3.40GHz (i remember being amazed at how much better this was than my previous pc)

**Mobo**: Asus Sabertooth Z77 

**RAM:** 16gb DDR3 

**GPU**: GIGABYTE - NVIDIA RTX 4060 WINDFORCE OC 8GB GDDR6 (ik it's insane to pair this with a 3770, but i bought this with the intent of putting it into a new pc later. That time has come!)

**PSU**: Thermaltake Smart 500W

**Monitor**: Acer G235H (23-in, 60hz, 1080p)  (I'm gonna keep using this, still works fine even after like 10 years)

**Case**: Thermaltake Armor Series VA8000BWS Black Aluminum / Steel ATX Full Tower Computer Case (it’s huge, like 35 pounds. Help.)

**SSD**: Western Digital Blue 500 GB 2.5"" Solid State Drive (will stick this into my new pc)

**HDD**: Seagate BarraCuda 500 GB 3.5"" 7200 RPM Internal Hard Drive (also sticking this in)

To give you guys an idea of how my current setup fares, I can comfortably animate about 3 characters (roughly 15k vertices per char) at once with decent FPS (13-22 depending on if I turn on or off textured view).  My files aren't super heavy, there's never more than like roughly 200k polygons.  90% of the time, my render times are all below 1 second per frame.  I use the Eevee render engine and have no interest in using Cycles (Eevee and Cycles are basically less realism+render time vs. more realism+render time).  

Seeing as I don’t have very advanced requirements in gaming, editing, or animating, I’m hoping that I can afford to be...lax? about my choices, because literally any CPU manufactured in the last couple years has surely gotta be a giantass noticeable upgrade, right?  Also I definitely dont need the best technology.

If it helps you guys review my setup, my ultimate priority is animating.  I doubt I’m gonna move my art style beyond simple anime-style, but who knows? I might try using realistic, higher-poly models some day.

My budget is $1500 (note: using Microcenter's prices, this setup is only about $1,100), and I’ve had intel all my life, but after hearing about their faulty 13/14gen CPU fiasco, I want to try AMD.  Not interested in overclocking, but I might try undervolting. Here’s the setup I’ve decided on:

The new nvme drive will be my new boot drive.  I went with the 9700x over 7000 gen because I hear it’s more energy-efficient and has lower temperatures. And in blender, its performance compared to the more expensive higher 9-gen CPU's is essentially the same.  Also, my microcenter’s got a 9700x + B650 + 32RAM bundle for $450.  I'm also aware of how more expensive the noctua is, I want that silence lol my current PC is not the quietest and it hasn't gotten any better in its age.

1jirypc,Mom needs help for disabled kid’s computer,"My kid with disabilities is excited for an upcoming esports tournament at their school. “Marvel Rivals” was voted by the students as the game choice for the esports student tournament. Unfortunately the Steam platform causes his computer to crash whenever he tried to load it. All I could afford on a limited income was this computer from Amazon: Lenovo ThinkCentre M92p High Performance Small Factor Form Business Desktop Computer, Intel Core i5-3470 3.2GHz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD, DVD, Windows 10 Professional (Renewed)

Does anyone have anyone helpful affordable solutions I could learn from YouTube or something that I could do to get his computer not to crash so he could play in the upcoming esports tournament? He was so excited to connect with kids his age at school who play video games and participate in the esports tournament as he gets excluded a lot due to his disabilities. 

This mom would appreciate some computer tech advice.

I’m overwhelmed by everyone’s advice and support. I’ve tried to respond to many of the responses as I can. I understand from the comments our computer is just too old for the newer games. We aren’t able to replace the computer at this time, but from the suggestions it seems cloud gaming for the practice for, and participation in, the esports tournament is the better temporary option for us; although I learned there is drawbacks and costs associated with cloud gaming as well. But based on suggestions, I’m going to look for an Ethernet cable to connect our computer to our internet to help for cloud gaming. After getting better informed from everyone’s advice, I contacted the school and my son will be connecting with the teacher coordinating the esports tournament in hopes of participating.

1jmgoa5,"Just moved from a 1080p monitor to a 2k, and I can't believe what I was missing!","After a slow pc upgrade journey, I was finally able to recently get my first powerful gpu, 4070 super. I was still using it with my 1080p monitor. 

I considered the GPU switch as the biggest drastic change out of all the upgrades. Yes, now the games were running at much higher fps and I was enjoying it pretty much even on a 1080p monitor. But I had no idea there will be another upgrade that will overshadow even my gpu switch experience.

I made 3 monitor upgrades only in the 1080p segment. So you can understand how long I had been stuck with 1080p. I could never go to 1440p earlier due to weak gpus plus I always thought the switch won't make any big difference going from a 24 inch to a 27inch display.

Now finally I bought a 1440p monitor (ROG XG27ACS), it is literally fuckin shock to the eyes! As if atleast 1440p is the way the developers want games to be felt. Games look so immersive now! I am playing the games I have already finished again just to experience them in the best visual form. 

Now I just freely roam around in the games because 1440p naturally brings that flavour in atmosphere of the games. I adore houses on the sides, npcs, terrain, weather in crispy form. It immediately gives too much to the games.

In case there are still people who are confused about making the switch, count this post as another addition to the 1440p supremacy.

1j5mosr,Bought a used 2080ti and this is what happened..,"The card looked in good condition, and got it for $450 aud, and was gonna be a nice upgrade from a 2060 (in my head, was like upgrading to a 4060+ and with way more vram for cheaper). Anyway, installed it and it ran terribly. Temps immediately reaching 82 degrees, but and fps tanking to around the 2060 levels. So after seeing it was throttling down to 150 watts from 250 watts, and that I noticed when minimizing the game a bit and coming back to it I’d get a nice fps jump before the temps would rise and it would throttle again, I decided to open the card up.

Eventually opened up the card and it revealed hardly any thermal paste left on the thing, and what there was was dried out. Ultimately put a nice fresh coat of it on, and the thing runs beautifully. Under max load I’m getting highest of 69 degrees in a warm room, and even at 100% fan speed in testing the card runs so much quieter than the 2060 tuf I had.

1jcgqpp,PC troubleshooting is really exhausting and is not talked about in most tutorials,"This week, I built a PC with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an RX 7900 XT on an ASUS ROG B650E-F motherboard. My last build was in 2019, and while I have a solid understanding of PC components, I haven’t kept up with recent hardware changes.

During the build, I ran into a few issues that required some deep dives into Reddit threads and PC forums to figure out.

AM5 Boot Times

When I first powered on the system, the DRAM error LED lit up. I reseated the RAM, checked for damage, and retried several times. What I didn’t realize was that AM5 motherboards take a couple of minutes to train the memory on the first boot. Since my previous system booted in under 15 seconds, I kept shutting it off too soon. This isn’t something I had seen mentioned in any PC-building guides, but it would have saved me a lot of unnecessary troubleshooting.

EXPO/XMP Profile Issues

Once I got into the BIOS, I updated it and enabled the 6000MHz EXPO profile. After restarting, I got a VRAM error. I tried lowering it to 5600MHz, but the issue persisted.

Eventually, I found the solution: a small 3-pin jumper on the motherboard labeled CPU OC Control needs to be moved one pin to the right to allow higher voltage for memory overclocking. Without this, EXPO wouldn’t work. A lot of Youtube guides use this exakt model of ASUS B650E mainboard and none of the guides mentioned this, even though others have run into the same issue. 



Troubleshooting these issues took several hours, and I wish more PC-building content covered these essentials. A lot of people run into the same problems, but finding the right solutions often requires digging through forum posts instead of mainstream guides.

1jjhin2,Two (2) RTX 5090 and both gets black screen after installing drivers | 6000€ spent well in one week.,"Hey, just wanted to share my experience with the RTX 5090 since I ran into issue — black screen right after installing the drivers.

Before the drivers were installed, I *did* get a signal to the display, but Windows didn’t detect the GPU at all — it wasn’t showing up in Device Manager or Task Manager.

Here’s the kicker: the display always worked in Safe Mode, which made sense since Nvidia drivers aren’t loaded there.

I managed to get the drivers to install once and actually reached the desktop, but then I had insane stuttering constantly — even just moving the mouse around on the desktop was a laggy mess. Then when I tried to open the Nvidia Control Panel for the first time, the screen went black again and stayed that way indefinitely.

Things I tried:

* Every possible Nvidia driver version, including hotfix drivers — no help.
* Toggled PCIe Gen 3 and 4 in BIOS, tried forcing lanes for the GPU — nothing.
* Used DDU every time to wipe drivers in Safe Mode (also tried without Safe Mode) — no difference.
* CMOS reset, default BIOS settings — no change.
* Disabled Resizable BAR — no help.
* Tried both vertical mount with PCIe riser and direct to motherboard — same issue.
* Used the included Nvidia/Asus power adapter and also tried a couple of proper 12VHPWR cables — didn’t help.
* Flashed and tested different BIOS versions for the motherboard — nope.
* Updated chipset drivers — still broken.
* Tried single monitor setup, swapped monitors — didn’t help.
* Tried different HDMI and DP cables — same issue.
* Forced display refresh rates like 60Hz/120Hz — no effect.

There’s more stuff I tried that I didn’t even list — none of the usual Reddit/YouTube fixes helped.

Every time I plugged my old RTX 4090 back into the system, it worked **perfectly**, regardless of what kind of BIOS settings or messed-up state Windows or drivers were in after all the 5090 testing.

**Its either my MSI B650 Motherboard Bios problem, or Both of the RTX 5090 needs a new VBIOS update or NVIDIA Drivers.**

My rig:

* Ryzen 9 9800X3D
* MSI B650 Carbon WiFi
* 1000W ATX 3.1 PSU
* 64GB DDR5 6000MHz CL30
* Windows 11 24H2

**Extra note**: I even bought a **second** RTX 5090 from a different store the same week, and it had the **same exact issue** — black screen after driver install. Didn’t even bother trying dual-boot or a fresh Windows reinstall at that point. I was just done.

Honestly, when you drop €3000 on a GPU, it should *just work* after driver install. Instead, I spent the whole week battling this after work and burned over €6000 total. It’s beyond frustrating...

Posting here, because r/nvidia deleted my post.

**EDIT 28.3.2025** | MSI is looking into the issue with B650 series and X670 series compatibility with RTX 5000 series.  Both of the GPU's are fine in other brand motherboards and this seems to be MSI Bios compatibility issue with newest generation of GPU's.

**EDIT #2 28.3.2025** | The black screen issue with the RTX 5090 on Windows 11 seems to stem from a compatibility problem with MSI B650 motherboards not properly initializing the 5090's VBIOS. What’s likely happening is the BIOS isn’t fully parsing or handing off the option ROM correctly during POST, which causes the GPU to fail during driver initialization in full Windows. That’s why it boots fine in Safe Mode (where drivers aren’t active) or without any drivers at all. System avoids triggering whatever bug is in the BIOS’s PCIe or GOP aka Graphics Output Protocol handling. Until MSI updates the AGESA or firmware to properly support the 5090’s VBIOS structure, it’s basically a BIOS-level detection/init failure, not a driver or gpu's fault.",431,2025-03-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1jjhin2/two_2_rtx_5090_and_both_gets_black_screen_after/,322,buildapc

1jq7972,Rant: WD/SanDisk Snaps My SSD in Half to Void my Warranty and Keep my SSD Hostage,"To Keep It Short: 

After replacing almost everything in my computer to resolve a blue screen, SSD replacement seem to fix the issue entirely, leading to diagnosing the SSD as the issue. 

March 05, 2025: I talked to support about the defective drive. They couldn't do the advanced RMA (where they sent a drive first and I sent my defective drive once I receive the new drive) because they ran out of SN770 and requested that I send my drive in first to avoid delays. 

Used their shipping label and sent it in for repair. 

March 11, 2025: Warehouse receive the drive

March 21, 2025: Reached out for an update, Was told they are still out of SN770, but now are also out of SN850, SN850X, and SN7100 for alternative replacements. Informed that support will reach out for further instructions in 48h (they didn't)

March 27, 2025: Reached out to support for an update, told they cannot honor the warranty because drive was broken in half, induced by the customer... Furthermore, I would need to pay for the return of my SSD. Asked for a supervisor or direct line to internal team -> DENIED

Disputed that I have photo evidence that it was in one piece before being shipped out. Therefore, either warehouse team snapped it in half or it was done during shipping (which they would need to reach out to UPS about because I didn't make the label)

April 2, 2025: Dispute fail and they ""cannot provide any exception as \[they\] have received the damaged drive. As per \[their\] policy, any physical damage on the drive is not covered under warranty.

1js5joo,€4499 Razer Blade 17 Broken AGAIN After Warranty Repair - Razer is a SCAM,"Hey folks, I just wanted to update share the full saga of my Razer Blade 17 experience to warn others and hopefully get some eyes on this from Razer.



Back in July 2024, I bought a **Razer Blade 17 for €4499** directly from Razer. This was supposed to be one of their top-of-the-line laptops, and I was upgrading after previously owning a **Razer Blade 15 Base (2020)** and **Blade 15 Advanced (2022)** — the latter of which I paid around €2300 for. All my products are registered with Razer. On top of that, I’ve also bought multiple peripherals like mice, headsets, etc. At this point, I’ve spent nearly **€10,000 on Razer products** over the years.



Everything was fine until **November 2024**, when the Blade 17 suddenly wouldn’t power on. No lights, no nothing. The power cable glows green, but the laptop is a brick. I contacted support and was told to send it in for RMA.



Now here’s where the nightmare begins.



I live in **Ireland**, and the closest FedEx drop-off is nearly 80km away. Since I work long shifts and long days, I asked for a pickup. They said it was possible, I gave them **three different addresses**, and each time I got the same canned response:  

\> *“There are no pickups available at your location. Would it be possible to drop it off?”*



I made it clear that drop-off was NOT an option. Still, they kept repeating the same thing. After **33 emails back and forth**, I gave up and had to travel from Galway to Dublin (2.5h bus each way) just to drop it off.



They took around **2 weeks to repair it**, saying the issue was faulty RAM. Communication? Awful. They promised to notify me when the repair was done, but instead I came home one day to find the laptop randomly sitting at my door. Meanwhile, I got an email that **same day** saying there were still “no updates.”



Anyway, fast-forward — less than **two months later**, the exact **same problem happened again**, Laptop won’t turn on. Paperweight.



I contacted support a month ago, asking for a **replacement** this time. Seems pretty reasonable — I paid a lot  for a machine that failed twice in under 6 months. But no — they’ve been dodging, hiding behind “company policy,” and ignoring EU consumer rights.



I sent them a **formal letter of intent to pursue legal action**  (should be arriving at their Germany office any day now). I also sent the same letter via email, I gave them a **7-day deadline from March 28th**, clearly outlined in the letter. As of April 5th, still nothing. Their response? “Still under review.” One email per day. Automated messages telling me my case will be closed if I don’t respond — so I have to keep replying to keep it open, we are currently on **53 emails back and forth.**



Also, I EVEN offered to **pay the difference** in case my model is out of stock. No reply.



I’ve been without a laptop for a month for the second time, which has affected me **financially and emotionally**. I rely on it for work and everyday life — and the stress from dealing with their support has honestly been draining. A €4499 laptop is supposed to last more than a few months.



Since I was pretty frustrated on my first dealing with them back in November of 2024, I posted on here and currently it has 60k view. Maybe this full post will make them finally take it seriously.



**TL;DR:**

\- Bought €4499 Blade 17 in July ‘24  

\- Broke in November, sent for repair (faulty RAM)  

\- Broke AGAIN <2 months later  

\- Razer refuses to replace, blames “policy”  

\- Support is a never-ending loop of copy-paste replies  

\- I’ve spent €10k on Razer over the years, and this is the thanks I get  

\- Now a month without a laptop, support still “reviewing”



Let’s see if this gets any attention again. If you’re considering buying from Razer — especially their premium gear — DON'T.

1jon9h2,Im so pissed at windows 11,"Context: I play games like call of duty bo6, apex legends, battlefield 2042 (you get the picture) and do overclock my CPU (i9 14900k +360mm AIO)

I recently reinstalled windows 11 about 3-4 months ago. I usually do this once a year to keep windows fresh and to make sure windows doesn't get bogged down.  I did what I normally do like turning off core isolation/memory integrity and making sure I change settings that wont interfere with performance. Well after the reinstall I noticed that in the games mentioned above i would see high 80s-spikes to 90c. I thought the games had bad updates, but it was happening in CPU demanding games like the ones I play listed above.

  
I said screw that and took off my overclock which did help but I was still getting periodic high spikes to around 80c-85c when in game. I decided to re-paste my CPU to make sure, but nothing changed. I chalked it up to changes in windows or the games and left it for a while.

  
Today I decided to redownloaded black ops 6 to see if it was still happening and I still saw spikes to 90c and i seriously thought my cooler was broken. I downloaded HWInfo64 do some testing and in the main menu I saw a warning on the bottom saying ""virtual machine warning: Microsoft Hyper-V is active. some results may not reflect real hardware"". And I thought...I disabled core isolation/memory integrity... it should be completely off. Well, it was off, however I went into system information and saw in system summary ""Virtual based Security: Running"" 

  
Hyper V is turned off in windows features, core isolation is off. So why the hell is VBS still running? Well apparently, you have to manually do a REGISTRY EDIT to turn that crap off. So, I googled it, and did it, restarted my computer. Was very simple.

  
AND LO AND BEHOLD I am back in black ops 6 with 60-75c with my overclock back on. Apex used to have high spikes to 87c but what I get now is 65-74c. Battlefield is a very demanding game, so I thought 80c was normal. lol nope. Went down to 55-72c.

  
I legitimately thought some of my hardware was broken because windows decided that turning off something needs to be the hardest thing possible. I was literally about to buy a completely new cooler because of this bullshit. VBS added so much unnecessary heat to the CPU that it was almost causing me to get to 100c with just gaming.

  
Sorry for the wall of text, hopefully this may help anyone with the same problem as I had.

Rant over.

1jod0v3,9950XD Fried in ASRock Mobo (X870 RS Pro Wifi),"Hi everyone,

I wanted to report to you all that I have had a CPU failure that seems to be stemming from the chip suddenly overheating. Both the motherboard and the CPU was brand new bought off of microcenter. I'll try to be as detailed as possible in recounting what happened.

I built this rig around 3 weeks ago, all completely new parts. The GPU it was paired with was a 9070XT. There were no issues, I immediately updated the BIOS to the most current version, and I paired the CPU with an ID-Cooler AIO. Booted up fine, everything seemed normal, the only thing I noted was that the CPU's idle temperature seemed slightly warm. It was hovering around 50-58 but dropped as low as 45 at times. I just made a mental note that I should check the thermal paste, but I didn't see anything so unusual that I'd check it immediately.

I used the computer very lightly over the next two weeks, and played games such as the first kingdom come deliverance (was trying to build up to the sequel), some league, some valorant. I did notice that at times when I alt tabbed or alt r'd for the in game adrenaline overlay the entire screen would turn to static upon alt tab, or just the overlay would turn to static when I alt -r'd. I felt this was unusual, but alt-tabbing again fixed the issue immediately so I didn't think much on this.

Everything seemed fine until this week when I decided to game a bit more intensely. I had bought a new 4k OLed 32 inch monitor and I wanted to take it out for a spin. I booted up some more intense games to stress test as well as gaming on League (which i wouldn't consider intense at all) for several hours. When I went to make dinner everything was fine, when I came back the whole system was off except for my M.2 light.

I tried turning the system on but it would flicker momentarily and then shut off. I then unplugged my GPU and the system turned on but didn't post, I did see the motherboard's CPU and DRAM LED's stay on. When I checked the CPU I found that there was bubbling in one area (which i think pushed the contact pads into the pins causing indentation on the pads) and some discoloration suggesting scorch marks (see middle/bottom right of the image with red circle) on another area of the CPU. There is discoloration on the socket of the motherboard, but no bent pins. I strongly think this is a similar issue causing failures with the 9800X3Ds'. I will note, I don't know if this is an ASRock issue or not, it should be noted ASRock sells the most AMD 5 socket mobo's because it's cheaper which is why I gravitated toward it in the first place. I will attach images to this post so you guys can assess, please let me know if you have any questions that you feel can shed additional insight, I've tried to be as thorough as possible but am willing to think back to address any other questions.

1jqvt6y,WD/SanDisk deny refund upon return of unopened 4TB SN850X NVMe drive,"I saw this post today and decided to post my dispute with SanDisk:



[Rant: WD/SanDisk Snaps My SSD in Half to Void my Warranty and Keep my SSD Hostage : r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1jq7972/rant_wdsandisk_snaps_my_ssd_in_half_to_void_my/)



It shares similarities with that post from [FlimsyFriendship3481](https://www.reddit.com/user/FlimsyFriendship3481/).



tl;dr:

I placed 2 orders for 2x 4TB WD SN850X, attempted to cancel 1 and was not able to cancel it.

I returned the order I did not want, with the items brand new (unopened).

SanDisk claims their warehouse received a broken/altered/tampered drive and denied refund. I asked to escalate and investigate but was denied multiple times. They offered blurry pictures then said they cannot provide photos or video. They have not responded to my requests for additional information.



Details:

There was a deal for getting 2x NVMe drives via the SanDisk store. I placed an order for 2x 4TB WD SN850X on Feb 26. In the morning, I saw posts about a 20% discount by registering a WD SSD drive on SanDisk's website. I had another drive from a few months ago, so I registered and received a 20% code. I then tried to cancel the order from last night, but the website said cancellation was not possible, and that I should contact customer support. The 20% off was about a $80 discount, so I thought it was worth the risk of placing the 2nd order, then calling customer support to ideally cancel the first order, or perhaps cancel the 2nd order, but apply the 20% to the first order, should the first one no longer be cancelable.

When I called customer support, they informed me that they could not cancel either order, because those orders go directly into fulfillment at the warehouse, and they have no way to cancel or stop them from shipping.

Customer support assured me that I could reject the shipment that I did not want to keep, or do a return and send it back to SanDisk for a refund.

I received both orders on March 1. I took extra care of identifying the box with the order I wanted to return and opened that one only, verified the content (2x 4TB WD SN850X), then started the return process. I printed the UPS label, confirmed the serial numbers on both drives were correct (matched order info), then took a picture of the 2 unopened boxes, along with then UPS label. I ensured the UPS tracking number and drive serial numbers were readable. I thought that would be enough in case I had to proof which drives and order was sent back (and I thought there was a chance they could refund the wrong order).

My photo, taken March 1, then sent to SanDisk on March 17 and 18: 

[March 1 photo before packaging drives to return to SanDisk](https://preview.redd.it/2bs4ewhhzose1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd5488409146d398d06b6a322bc9c78bdcc4bc86)

On March 2, I dropped off the box with the 2 unopened drive at a nearby UPS store, and I got the receipt.

On March 13 I received an email from SanDisk stating:

\-----------------------------------  
Upon inspection of the drives returned under RMA XXXXXXXXXX, it was determined that the drives may have been altered and is not eligible for replacement under Sandisk’s limited warranty policy (https://support-en.sandisk.com/app/Warranty\_Policy). SERIAL NUMBER(S): Serial Number N/A

Please let us know how you would like to proceed:  
a. Scrap product(s) at Sandisk location at no cost.  
b. Ship the product(s) back to the customer at customer's cost.  
c. Contact Sandisk Global Customer Care for more information.  
Please respond by 26-Mar-2025. If we do not hear back from you on or before this date, Sandisk will take the action to scrap the product(s) on site.  
\-----------------------------------

I thought that was odd, because I did not request a replacement, I requested a return for a refund.

March 14 I contacted customer support over the phone. I explained the issue to Stephen. Afterwards, I received and email stating:

\-----------------------------------  
Please allow me to inform you that we have escalated this case to the concerned team so that they can check and investigate again. Once we receive any update on that we will be sharing the same with you.  
\-----------------------------------

By March 14, I had received a refund for 1 of the drives, so half the amount of the order. Hence, I thought it was even weirder that they refund 1 drive, but then claim the 2nd drive ""may have been altered"".

March 17 I get an email with this info from Stephen:

\-----------------------------------  
I would like to inform you that we had this case sent to the concerned team so that they can investigate again. We have received an update from them and as per the update we have received two drives out of which one of the drive is physically damaged. So, unfortunately we will not be able to initiate the refund for that drive.  
   
Furthermore, I have attached the pictures of the physically damaged drive to this email.

March 17: I responded over email stating that what they claim is not true. I sent in 2 unopened drives and should be refunded for both. I asked them to escalate to a manager. I included the 2 photos I took, which showed the UPS label, the 2 unopened drives with visible serial numbers.

March 18: I called customer support and asked to speak with a manager. They transfer me to Jessica. I re-explained the situation. She asks me to resend my photos. I kept her on the phone to get her to confirm receiving the photos and reading the serial numbers. She insists that she needs to send this to the warehouse team. I tell her that it had already been sent to the warehouse team and they sent back the blurry, generic pictures that did not match what I sent at all, and that this was a waste of time. She insisted she had no choice. She said she would call me back that same evening or the next day.

I got this email shortly after the call with Jessica, from Jessica:

\-----------------------------------  
Please allow me to inform you that I have forwarded your case to the dedicated team in order to reinvestigate the issue and will share the update as soon as possible.  
\-----------------------------------

March 19 I get this email from Jessica (she did not call as she said she would):

\-----------------------------------  
Please allow me to inform you that as per the update received from the dedicated team we were expecting brand new, untampered device however we received a tampered one hence we cannot initiate the refund for the second drive.

If you have any further questions or your issue is still unresolved, please reply to this email and we will be happy to assist you further.  
\-----------------------------------

At this point I am frustrated. I decided to reply via email to be able to make a more compelling and clear case.



This is most of my email to Jessica:

March 20:

===============================  
The story from the warehouse does not make sense. It is not correct.

The drives were sent in their original boxes, unopened, as in the photos I took and sent.

The photos provided by the warehouse do not show the drives that I sent, the box in which they were sent in, the packaging slip, the UPS shipping label, the original boxes, or any reference as to the photos being legitimate and taken during the process of unboxing the return box.

The photos are taken at an odd angle, are blurry, and do not look like the work of professionals in a warehouse.

Further, the original message at the start of this incident/case (Thursday, March 13) says the drives were ""not eligible for replacement"", which indicates a mix up at the warehouse, likely with another case where a customer had an RMA for \*\*replacing\*\* drives.

Mine are returns not replacements. That indicates my return was mixed up with another RMA for replacement.  
The photos from the warehouse do not match the product that I returned.

Also, the response that I have received has changes \[sic\] from altered to damaged to tampered.

March 13: drives may have been altered and is not eligible for replacement

March 17: out of which one of the drive is physically damaged

March 19: expecting brand new, untampered device however we received a tampered

This further shows the inconsistency throughout this entire incident/case.

Finally, I asked you (Jessica) to call me back when you heard back from the warehouse. You sent an email instead. I had mentioned that the warehouse's original response was incorrect, inconsistent, and could not be trusted. They have proven this twice now.  
I returned the items as new and SanDisk needs to be responsible and refund the entire order. If you cannot process the refund yourself, please escalate to your manager.

===============================  




March 21, I got an email from Alan. He identifies as one of the supervisors and wrote:

\-----------------------------------  
We have thoroughly investigated your concern, and our warehouse team has confirmed that they have received both of the drives. However, upon inspection, one of the drives was found to be tampered with. We have discussed this issue with our management team, and unfortunately, we are unable to process a refund for the drive due to its tampered \[sic\] condition.

We truly regret any frustration this situation may have caused and appreciate your understanding.

If you have any further questions, please reply to this email and we will be happy to assist you further.  
\-----------------------------------



March 23, I respond to Alan over email:

===============================

SanDisk has not yet provided evidence of the received drives. The only evidence is the 2 blurry photos with no context. I packaged both drives exactly as received and provided detailed photos showing the unopened products along with the specific UPS shipping label and the original packaging slip. It is all clearly visible. I dropped off the package at a UPS location (see new attachment) the next day, in person, and requested a receipt.  
===============================



March 25, I get a response from Alan via email:

\-----------------------------------  
We have carefully reviewed your request and discussed the matter with our higher management team. After thorough consideration, we regret to inform you that we are unable to provide a refund for the tampered product.

Additionally, please note that we do not provide photos or videos as part of our process.

Unfortunately, there is nothing further we can do regarding this matter. We understand that this may be disappointing, and we appreciate your understanding.  
\-----------------------------------

I was really puzzled by the ""please note that we do not provide photos or videos as part of our process"", when they had sent me the 2 pictures on March 17.



March 25, I respond to Alan:

===============================  
But you did provide photos as part of the process already! Photos that when I show to any reasonable person say that they are just generic photos that prove nothing!

At this point, you are clearly lying to your customers.

If you have discussed this with the warehouse and higher management team, you should have ample evidence to prove your case. But you insist is not sharing details.

1jsa8it,Amazing deal on 4080,"I was looking for a graphics card to replace my 3060, and I found someone selling a whole 4080 pc for $2000. I offered them $650 for the 4080, and they accepted. I picked up the card and drove to Microcenter, where they tested it, and… no display. I was freaking out, but the seller was messaging me back claiming that the card should work, and I didn’t think I got scammed. I asked them if they potentially had another test bench, and they took it to the back, where they came back saying that it displayed. The amount of relief I felt in that moment was incredible. We assumed it was an issue with the riser cable they were using to check the card. Thought I would share my story here. Card was tested under load at Microcenter and had no issues.

1jcmm86,100 hours of updating my BIOS…,"well, this is getting absurd.

For those who haven’t heard, I started updating my BIOS about 4 days ago now, and we’re still going up to now

I figure I might as well put some commonly asked questions here:

-dual BIOS? it’s a BioStar A320MH… No lol

-BIOS flashback? see previous

-RMA? sadly I got this and the 1200 attached to it used, and they’re both from 2018. Not gonna happen

-what USB? I actually did this by just selecting the file on my boot SSD in the BIOS update utility. Could be what caused it, IDK

-UPS? nope, just good ol’ (un)reliable Philippines electricity!

-why even update? 2018 BIOS… I read on the page that there were some stability fixes on the newer BIOS versions and thought why not? Definitely regretting it now…

-what does purple even mean? pretty sure it’s just empty space created from erasing the old BIOS

-stream when? now!: https://www.youtube.com/live/p7TP3YCpUPk?si=rmCD92eH9L3EXXE5

-PC specs? Ryzen 3 1200, GTX 1660. 4GB 2400MHZ, Gigabyte P650B, Transcend 128GB SSD and of course BioStar A320MH rev 6.0

-is this your main PC? thankfully no, it’s just a PC I built to put in my dorm. 

-main PC specs? Ryzen 5 8400F, RTX 4060, 16GB 5200MHZ (RAM is expensive here okay…) MSI A650BN, Transcend 220S 2TB SSD and Gigabyte B650M K

-did you buy a BIOS programmer yet? yup! it arrives next week

thank you to everyone who’s followed me on this so far, this has gotten so out of hand lol. And yes, I saw Mutahar’s video.

1jgacyc,"I bought over $1000 dollars worth of ""For parts or not working"" AM5 motherboards on ebay and these were my results.","In a time where PC gaming seems more expensive that ever, I thought this might be fun to do as a way to possibly save some money.  
  
I bought 40 B650, B650M, A620, and A620M motherboards from ebay sold as ""**For parts or not working**"" for a grand total of $1169.90 after taxes. (So around $1100 pre tax)

Most of the motherboards issues were bent pins which I attempted fixing with a sharp tweezer and my iPhone 11 camera. Many of the motherboards also had missing M.2 heatsinks.

I got 25 of the motherboards to post and work **\*after fixing the bent pins\***, and 2 motherboards worked after fixing the pins and updating the BIOS . 3 motherboards worked straight outta the box. The motherboards that are working can be seen in the picture.

The rest 10 motherboards had pins completely snapped off or did not post at all. Some also posted but only with 1 ram stick and I thought that was not good enough as you lose dual channel support. All 10 I simply donated to my ewaste recycling center after stripping the M.2 heatsink from each and reusing that on the working motherboards.

In total, I paid roughly $37 per \***working\*** motherboard. Some of them might be missing accessories like IO shield or M.2 shield but aftermarket ones are cheap to find.

For anyone wanting to try or replicate to snag a AM5 board for cheap, these are things that I noticed while fixing these boards:

* Aim for B650, B650M, A620, or A620M boards. I find that X670 and X870 prices regularly go up to $100 for a broken board which I find not worth considering the risks you have to take. Most of these AM5 boards would do just fine for daily uses. I also wouldn't pay more than $40 for 1 ""broken"" motherboard.
* Most of the boards that I fixed had Q-flash for BIOS updates meaning you can even drop in a Ryzen 9000 series CPU which I am using one of the Gaming X AX V2 boards with my 9800 X3D
* You might be missing a few accessories like M.2 screw, M.2 heatsink, IO shield, or WIFI antennas. These things did not bother me since you can find all of these on sites like Ebay or Aliexpress very cheaply.
* Take your time bending back any pins, these pins are more delicate towards the top, but surprisingly durable at the base due to how the top tapers off into the contact point.
* Be **VERY CAREFUL** to not have any pins touching each other or you can possibly have a short and your motherboard might let that magic smoke out and kill your CPU. Luckily this didn't happen to me.
* If you think you got all the pins straighten up, and the board still didn't post, you still have another option to save it. I would use the Q-flash to update the BIOS and I had 2 motherboards saved this way, one that didn't post at all, and the other one detecting only 1 ram stick. Both posted after updating BIOS and detected both ram sticks.

All in all, this was a very fun experience saving 30 of the 40 motherboards. I might follow up with my tools and setup to show how I was able to fix these boards if people would be interested in that.",9349,2025-03-21,https://i.redd.it/rraqhslqjzpe1.jpeg,256,pcmasterrace

1jnv5jb,Locking Down Windows Firewall Rules kills APPX application re-registration and update.,"(This is just an observation for (Web Search) posterity)

I lock down the Windows Defender Firewall Rules via a registry hack (I only have 3 firewall rules):

""Everyone"" Deny permission on: ""HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\FirewallRules""

Locking the firewall rules messes with the Microsoft APPX Application installation as it will kill the application's reregistration/update. This may cause problems with your UWP APPX applications or at least will be confusing.

For example, if a forced ""reregistration"" of the APPX applications (to try to fix some issue) is done via powershell with the usual: 

""Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ""$($\_.InstallLocation)\\AppXManifest.xml""}"" 

The Add-AppxPackage command will get the following error for some apps:

""Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6, Package could not be registered. error 0x80070005: Windows cannot create the AppContainer profile ...""



The APPX install log will have ""Access Denied"".  The mysterious ""Access Denied"" is because it can't write its firewall rule into the  registry.

I use almost no APPX apps including the start menu APPX app and religiously uninstall them.  The only ones I could theoretically use are Windows system config APPX applications.    So it took a long time before I even noticed this issue.",2,2025-03-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/1jnv5jb/locking_down_windows_firewall_rules_kills_appx/,3,windows10
1jsgfzm,BSOD on AMD Ryzen ? Here's how to fix it:,"After getting more than 70+ BSODs or Blue Screen of Death(s) in the last 3 months (From January 14th till April 5th), I finally fixed it. 

I installed/uninstalled/deleted/repaired/resetted/in-place-upgraded drivers, programs and components during the past 3 months as a part of debugging. I re-installed Windows 10 3 times during the past 24 hours and got fix that way. 

BSOD started happening after installing the update for January 2025. 

Context: My laptop has Ryzen 5 4600H, 32GB + 1TB + 1TB Config. It came with Windows 10 Home SL but you WILL have to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for this work. Luckily I have a friend who helped me get a license for the same. 



This method should work with Ryzen 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 series. This is working on my laptop (4600H) and my client's office desktop PC (3200G) as of April 6th, 2025. 



What will you lose: 

1. A lot of time. This method will require you to re-install using ISO file/bootable drive

2. All installed programs. You will have to manually re-install those. 



What you won't lose: (if you're careful) 

1. Your files, on C:/ 

2. Your app data, like browsers' profile incase you want to restore them. 





If you're getting a BSOD with random stop code like IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL or KMODE\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION or any other on a daily basis (I once got 3 BSOD in just 6 hours), and you think/know/'re sure that there was no hardware change and these BSODs started appearing out of nowhere then this method is worth a try. 



**What's Required:** 

1. A pendrive (with at least 7GB free) 

2. Windows 10 ISO from 2024

3. Download amd graphics drivers (full installer) and chipset drivers (full installer) and keep them either in your pendrive or directly inside C:/ 





**PreRequisite:** 

Newer MediaCreation based ISO will not work. You will have to use an iso file which was created in 2024, and before January 2025.

I used this file, it's 100% from the mediacreationtool: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQoYYwqFizc0wkMCiL7JodtvBj-altW3/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQoYYwqFizc0wkMCiL7JodtvBj-altW3/view?usp=sharing)



**For the installation to happen you must have at least 35GB of space on the drive where you already have windows or where you want it to install (if you want to reinstall Windows 10 on that drive).** 



Create a bootable Pen Drive using Rufus, use GPT (all new laptops come with GPT based partitioned hard drives) and keep everything to default without bypassing anything. 





**Step 1: Installation of Windows 10. DISABLE INTERNET BY UNPLUGGING ETHERNET CABLE, WIFI can't connect automatically so.** 



Boot into your bootable pendrive which you made. 



a. Select your language, currency and keyboard, hit Next. 

b. Click on ""Install Now"".

b.1. In case it asks for a key, click on ""I don't have a key"" and then select ""Windows 10 Pro"". 

c. Accept notices and license terms and conditions and click on Next. 

d. When you're on ""Which type of installation do you want?"" step, choose the SECOND option which says ""Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)""  < This will push your previous install ation to a folder called Windows.old (in my case I had Windows.old000 and Windows.old001 too). 



e. Now you will have to carefully select the partition on which your previous windows installation was OR where you want to install Windows in. After selecting the desired partition click on Next and follow through the installation. 



\[If you dunno how to continue with the installation, watch this video from 52 seconds: [https://youtu.be/\_btIvO2UNSY?feature=shared&t=52](https://youtu.be/_btIvO2UNSY?feature=shared&t=52)  \]





**Step 2:\[Preparing Windows\] If you're on Windows 10 Pro then skip this. If your installation was of Windows 10 Home Single Language, then follow:** 



a. Assuming you have kept the internet off during the entire time, open settings (press WinKey + i) > Update & Security > Activation. 

b. Click on change product key > Enter ""VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T"" as the product key and click on next/start. It will start the upgrade from Home to Pro and will restart your laptop/computer once it's finished. 

c. Note: You will need a valid product key to continue using Windows 10 Pro. 

d. Once it's rebooted, open settings (WinKey + i) > Update & Security > Activation and check if ""Edition"" is showing Windows 10 Pro or not. 





**Step 3: \[Group Policy Edit\] \[Note: This will not require you to manually edit registry using regedit\]**

a. Open ""This PC"" from File Explorer. Right-Click on blank area > Click on ""Properties"". From the left side options, Click on ""Advanced system settings"".

a.2. (2nd way) Open settings (press WinKey + i) > Recovery > Click on ""Restart Now"". 

b. It will give you a bunch of option (when done right), just click on ""Continue to Windows 10"" and your PC will restart (it will boot slower this time) 







**Step 6: Install AMD drivers (graphics and chipset) which you had kept safely in the beginning.** 



**Step 7: Connect to Internet and Enjoy**



**Step 8: Keep an eye on Windows Update > View Update History, to check if it installed drivers without your knowledge.** 





Windows Update was installing a AMD System driver v20.x.x.1 or something and that's what was causing the BSOD (for me). 



Windows 10 Home can NOT disable Windows Update entirely. Your registry edits/disabling windowsupdate service won't work. 



Ping me (before) in case you're thinking of trying this method.

And yesterday I bought some DVD for watching anime, the screen go flickering again when I opened the video file.

I used Potplayer to play the video. Then I found that if I select a hardware render API like OpenGL or DirectX, it worked fine. Once I switched to a software rendered, it began flickering again, as same as when I opened the midi file. Playing video at other situations like online video is fine.

I tried almost everything I can to fix this except to reinstall windows, that gonna take too long to restore my thing. But this problem is too weird I don't even know what caused it.

After my diagnosis, it's not a graphic card or driver issue, not sound blaster issue, not RAM issue, not monitor issue. Maybe just one or more system components are broken?

Has anyone met the same problem like me? The bug is becoming charming cause I never saw a problem like this, it's too weird! That made me so curious.

I am testing enabling those checkboxes and set it to 500mbps (well beyond the networking capability of the machine in question, but right at 100% of my internet connection).

1je10z9,What's the best way to copy files between machines while preserving hardlink structure,"I need to transfer files from one PC to another, 
while re-creating the same hardlink and symlink structure on the destination drive as it was on the source.

The programs which could supposedly do that were:

* rsync (cwRsync) 
* Link Shell Extension
* WinRar.

Robocopy does not work, its incapable of re-creating hardlinks.

WinRar and Link Shell Extension are out in my case due to the large amount of files needing to be transferred (up to 1TB, a million files)

That leaves rsync

However, the destination PC from which the transfer is initiated doesn't see the hardlinks on the source PC. Apparently its a limitation of the network shares in Windows, with the source being on one. This means that rsync doesn't see them too, and thus it can't re-create the hardlinks in the destination.
________________

Another issue discovered - even in local transfer tests, hardlinks is the only thing that rsync re-creates.

- try these 20 steps, if all fails, reinstall OS.

  
The answers on there never understand the actual problem, so they never get close to the solution.

The PSA is to always skip that site altogether, and check out more user-dedicated forums (even Reddit is decent for this).

  
Here for posterity is my example:

Now the first result will have you literally spending all day, several hours work, doing pointless troubleshooting.  Because the guy - a self-described ""installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP"" simply does not understand the problem, so will throw everything at it.

This is [answers.microsoft.com](http://answers.microsoft.com) in a nutshell.

  
The second search result, is a more user-dedicated forum (which I haven't actually heard of before).  Here, the click directs to the solution, which takes 10 seconds to apply and test.  Don't even need to restart Explorer.  Thankfully, I gave up on the first result without wasting any time.

  
Moral of the story is: don't trust long generic copy/paste lists of troubleshooting, look for answers where it seems like the responder understands your specific issue.  If in doubt, make a thread here on this subreddit (or indeed, on tenforums).

  
Here are the links for anyone interested:

1d6pdk9,"If Windows 11 has you thinking of switching to Linux when 10 reaches eol, do this first","Since I've seen a lot of people saying this elsewhere, here's how to make things easier for yourself.

1) try using cross platform software as 
much as you can. The transition will be a lot easier.

2) make sure that any windows exclusive software you need can be used in a virtual machine. Anything that needs kernel level access like Vanguard or proctoring software is a no-go.

3) **Try before you buy** Linux can be used without installing, which is good because you may need to try several distros first. I suggest Mint if you're a general user, something more bleeding edge if you're a gamer like Bazzite or Chimera-OS or something. You'll have more recent hardware suppor along with the latest drivers.

4) DUALBOOT NOW! Don't go off the deep end when it reaches eol, get familiar with it now. Plus, the higher Linux market share gets, the more likely software getting ported is, so you'll help everyone by dual-booting now.

1bjqq8g,Fix for Windows Update KB5034441 that keeps failing,"Hi fellow System Admins,

EDIT: I have tried the below solution on five different PC's now running Windows 10, and it fixed the issue on all of them, without having to resize the RE partition.

If you, like me, has been annoyed by the ""recent"" KB5034441 Update that keeps failing, and no suitable fix has been released by Microsoft yet. Or if you, like me, doesn't even have Windows RE-partition enabled, and the update somehow still fails (even though the update should be redundant in in this case), and have been reading various fixes including Microsoft's own [Powershell-script](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5025175-updating-the-winre-partition-on-deployed-devices-to-address-security-vulnerabilities-in-cve-2022-41099-ba6621fa-5a9f-48f1-9ca3-e13eb56fb589) or [manual approach](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5028997-instructions-to-manually-resize-your-partition-to-install-the-winre-update-400faa27-9343-461c-ada9-24c8229763bf), that doesn't fix the issue (or at least not for me), please read this small guide on how to solve this issue for good in a relatively easy manner:

1. Use a program like Veeam, Macrium or Acronis to backup your PC before continuing. Not that these steps are very unlikely to cause any system issues, but they do include altering system files, so better be safe than sorry.
2. Open CMD as Admin and write `reagentc /info` to determine if Windows RE is enabled or not. If it's already disabled, continue, otherwise write `reagentc /disable` to disable it.
3. Go to the [Windows site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d) to create Installation Media for Windows and download the corresponding Tool for your system
4. Open the Tool and choose ""Create Installation Media"" > Next > ISO file > download the ISO file somewhere on your C-drive, e.g. *C:\\ISO\\* > Mount the ISO-file in Explorer > Take note of the Drive Letter (e.g. E:)
5. Go back to CMD and write: `DISM.exe /Get-ImageInfo /ImageFile:[Drive Letter]:\sources\install.esd /Index:1`
6. Write in CMD: `DISM.exe /Export-Image /SourceImageFile:[Drive Letter]:\sources\install.esd /SourceIndex:1 /DestinationImageFile:C:\install.wim /Compress:fast /CheckIntegrity`
7. Create a new dir: *C:\\MountDir*
8. Write in CMD: `DISM.exe /Mount-Wim /WimFile:C:\install.wim /index:1 /MountDir:C:\MountDir /ReadOnly`
9. Open *C:\\MountDir\\Windows\\System32\\Recovery\\* and copy both *ReAgent.xml* and *Winre.wim.* Paste both files in a new directory somewhere else, as these files will be used later.
10. Write in CMD: `DISM.exe /Unmount-Wim /MountDir:C:\MountDir /discard`. This will empty the directory and unmount the DISM image.
11. Delete the folders *C:\\MountDir, C:\\ISO* (unmount first) and the file *C:\\install.wim*.
12. Copy the two files from the directory you copied them to earlier, and paste them into *C:\\Windows\\System32\\Recovery\\*. Replace the file(s) if they already exists.
13. Write in CMD: reagentc /enable
14. Attempt to run a Windows Update again, and this time it should install the KB5034441 update.

The nice thing is now that you have a portable solution to the problem. The next machine you need to fix for this issue, you simply have to do the following:

1. Open CMD and write: `reagentc /disable`
2. Copy the two files to *C:\\Windows\\System32\\Recovery\\*
3. Write in CMD: `reagentc /enable`
4. Run Windows Update, and voila

The simplicity of this fix once you have the two files, makes it easy to implement as a GPO or simple script that distributes these files to *C:\\Windows\\System32\\Recovery\\* and write the CMD commands.

I hope this guide will find its way and can be used by other system admins desperately seeking to find a solution in this headless Windows world.",206,2024-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/1bjqq8g/fix_for_windows_update_kb5034441_that_keeps/,40,windows10
1bvjxhw,"When will Microsoft eventually fix Windows Update (KB5034441) ""Download error"" Code: 0x80070643?","When trying to update the KB5034441 update it keeps failing with the following error code: 0x80070643

This update has been failing for well over  3 months now. I do know that Microsoft has given workarounds to ""Fix it"" by messing around with partitions, but i am not going to screw around partitioning once again....

Beside that workaround. The partition of mine is well over 1000mb?

Messing with partitions could lead to even more problems. Microsoft should fix their mistakes....



  
------------------------------------  
- Edit:  
------------------------------------

I think i might have found the fix in my case.

Since my partition was big enough for the update i went and took the following steps:

i checked if WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment) was enabled on my device (in my case it was) > disabled it > enabled it > re-tried the windows update again and it went through (FINALLY (-.-') )......



The steps i took to fix the update in my case was:

1. open CMD (Commpandpromt) as an administrator (Rightclick on CMD > open as admin)

2. used the command ""reagentc /info"" to check if Windows RE (WinRE) is enabled on the device.

3. disabled WinRE with the following command  ""reagentc /disable""

4. re-enabled WinRE with the following command ""reagentc /enable""

5. re-tried the windows update (this went through successfully this time)

This did the trick for me. Hope it helps a few of you out there with the same problem good luck!

1jnfsdg,Arrow Lake performance re-examinated (what Intel left behind at launch),"As is well known, Intel was not satisfied with the performance results at the launch of Arrow Lake. Better gaming performance was promised via BIOS updates and Windows patches before the end of 2024, but this did not materialize. Various test reports indicated minor improvements from time to time, but nothing substantial. However, the final patches did not arrive until February 2025 anyway, which means that the improved performance of Arrow Lake can only be shown now.

With the launch of Ryzen 9 9950X3D, as many benchmarks as possible of all three K models of Arrow Lake and Raptor Lake Refresh (together with Ryzen 9000X) were therefore also recorded in order to be able to offer a completely updated performance picture. A direct comparison of old and new ARL benchmarks would certainly be more accurate, but unfortunately such figures are not available as the hardware testers are constantly fine-tuning their test fields and test conditions.

This short article (long form at [3DCenter](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/eine-neubetrachtung-der-arrow-lake-performance)) will take a closer look at the performance improvement in comparison to Core i-14000 and Ryzen 9000 in order to correct the performance differences established at launch. At its launch, Arrow Lake was measured with an average of +0.3% application performance and –5.8% gaming performance compared to Ryzen 9000 (average of the three K models vs the biggest three X models).

&nbsp;

Intel has left a some of potential gaming performance behind at the launch of Arrow Lake. Not so much compared to the Raptor Lake Refresh, but compared to AMDs Ryzen 9000. The progress at gaming performance of Arrow Lake between the benchmarks from October to March is sufficient for Arrow Lake to no longer lag behind Ryzen 9000 by –5.8%, but to reduce the gap to –1.6%. At the same time, at the duel of the top SKUs (Core 9 Ultra 285K vs Ryzen 9 9950X), there is now a tie in gaming performance.

However, it is questionable whether the updated performance result would have really helped Arrow Lake to look better at its launch. After all, Intel's own Raptor Lake Refresh is still ahead in terms of gaming performance, and Arrow Lake can still only compete with AMD's X models, but by no means with the X3D models. The (average) +17.5% increase in gaming performance propagated by Intel as a result of the patches for Arrow Lake is a long way off.

&nbsp;

TLDR — **What Intel has left behind in terms of performance at the Arrow Lake launch:**

- Note: all comparative values based on the average of the three K models from Arrow Lake compared to the three K models from the Raptor Lake refresh and the three larger X models from AMD (no X3Ds)
- +2.0% more application performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Core i-14000K
- +0.3% more application performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Ryzen 9000X (= within measurement tolerance)
- +1.5% more gaming performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Core i-14000K
- +4.5% more gaming performance of Core Ultra 200K compared to Ryzen 9000X
- now averaging 95.9% of the gaming performance level of Core Ultra 200K compared to Core i-14000K (compared to 94.5% before)
- now averages 98.4% of the gaming performance level of Core Ultra 200K compared to Ryzen 9000X (compared to 94.2% before)
- Core Ultra 9 285 reaches the gaming performance of the Ryzen 9 9950X (now +0.3% compared to –4.2% before)
- Sources: averaged results of the launch reviews for [Arrow Lake (from October 2024)](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-intel-arrow-lake) and [Ryzen 9 9950X3D (from March 2025)](https://www.3dcenter.org/artikel/launch-analyse-amd-ryzen-9-9900x3d-9950x3d)

This is getting ridiculous, it has been several months now and this issue still has not been fixed, as far as I can tell it started with the 572.xx driver. Spending AU$1500 on a graphics card and then having it not work properly within 1 year (or be locked out of certain games because I am not using the latest drivers) is unacceptable. Rolling back to 566.36 drivers fixes the issue for me, but then I am locked out of certain games (e.g. Half Life 2 RTX) and newer features, which will become worse over time.

Problem: Cyberpunk 2077 will crash entire PC. This problem happens on all 572.xx drivers that I have tried and does not occur in 566.xx drivers. Something Nvidia has changed in 572 drivers has damaged stability. I suspect it happens in other games as others have reported, but I'm not interesting in corrupting my Windows install.

1jmqajy,Dead 9800X3D's in AsRock Boards,"So I been following the AsRock sub since I bought my setup a little while ago, I ended up with a Gigabyte X870 wifi 7 elite which has ran absolutely fine since I got it a few months ago. Anyways, I been following this dead chips saga and witnessing AsRock continue to deny they have done anything wrong along with the users in their sub who keep recommending these boards to poor customers who end up with a dead chip within 3 months.

Just in the last 24 hours there's FOUR dead 9800's.

That's just the last 24 hours. There's hundreds more and it's always after like a month or two possibly three. What pisses me off is people are spending 500 dollars on these chips, and getting recommended these boards that are without a shadow of a doubt killing these chips by some kind of overvolting situation. AsRock has denied any culpability in the matter and are blaming it entirely on AMD, meanwhile if you visit any of the other brands subreddit you won't find a dead 9800 post a day that keeps the fucking Dr away.

It's really agitating to see their users continue to deny the reality. Gamernexus needs to dive back into this situation because it's really getting wild.

I could post a dozen or more links easily right now. Stop recommending these boards to people for everyone's sake.

EDIT: Gunna update this thread with new dead AM5 chips here's a brand new one after posting this. Also want to reiterate this is not happening on other board manufacturers. Just AsRock.

1ei1zvm,Intel has denied two of my 14900K RMAs (instability) and stated they will confiscate or destroy them if I proceed with the warranty process.,"MAJOR UPDATE 6:20PM EST 08/02/2024: Intel, as a result of the backlash from this, has gotten back to me with a ""second review"" and determined that BOTH CPUs were indeed valid!!! Image here: [https://imgur.com/a/DiW8uz8](https://imgur.com/a/DiW8uz8)

Hi Everyone. I'm very disheartened to share this news as a longtime and loyal Intel customer. I've purchased roughly $20,000 worth of merchandise with them over my lifetime and I've never once had to open any RMA requests until now. Unfortunately, it's very clear they are not standing behind their products and I'm going to provide to ton of detail and pictures below on what happened involving TWO retail boxed 14900Ks, one purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023 (this was the release date of the 14900K for anyone not in the know) which was shipped from and sold by [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), and one from Microcenter (brand new, not open box or anything like that, grabbed right off the shelf) on 02/11/2024, both experiencing the wide-spread instability issues.

Intel has claimed that both products are ""re-marked"" and not genuine. The problem is that they definitely are not re-marked. They also tried to claim that one of them was a tray processor and thereby not subject to retail warranty, which they backtracked on, and then went the route of claiming it was re-marked.

Full disclosure: Intel provided me with letters stating that the CPUs are not genuine and asked me to return them to their respective stores for a solution. I've done this and both stores, despite being WAY outside of return windows, DID refund me. Amazon gave me a full refund to my original payment method, and Microcenter gave me a full refund in store credit. In the end this worked out better for me, but that's beside the point. Now these two companies are having to shoulder the cost and burden of Intel's failure to take responsibility, and that's not right.

That being said, I'll be providing uncensored pictures of the retail boxes and CPUs which will show the full batch numbers and the full serial numbers. Since these CPUs are not in my possession anymore, and are ultimately going back to Intel, I feel it's fine to share them in their totality.

Here's the details:

The processor purchased from Microcenter on 02/11/2024, partial serial 02096:

I filled out the RMA form. Intel got back to me the next day admitting that the CPU was faulty. They then asked me for my shipping details and proof of purchase. I provided it. They then asked for pictures of the IHS. I provided it. Another day passes and they get back to me stating that the CPU is not genuine and is re-marked. WHAT!? This is news to me. This was purchased from a reputable retailer directly off the shelf. It was not open box, the seal was completely intact, and there was absolutely nothing suspicious about it. Furthermore, it showed correctly in CPU-Z as a 14900K and frequencies checked out, boosting to 6GHz single core and 5.7GHz all-core. I conveyed all of this information to Intel, and provided additional pictures of the IHS and the serial number just in case the previous pictures were too blurry. I also provided a picture of the retail box, clearly showing the full serial number and batch number, which did match the CPU. I also plugged in the batch number and serial number into Intel's warranty checker tool and it came back as valid with warranty until 2027. I took a screenshot of that and provided it as well. You can see all of those images in the image link below. They got back to me and said that their response hasn't changed and that they cannot divulge their investigation process. They insisted I return it to Microcenter with a letter they provided that it was not genuine. I did so, and Microcenter took a look. They said there was absolutely no evidence of tampering. The only thing they thought it might be was that there was some thermal paste still on the side of the CPU, and they said it made it look like it could have been delidded (however they confirmed it was NOT delidded). They suggested reporting their findings to Intel, and wiping away the paste and taking new pictures. I then reported those finding to Intel, to which they repeated that they cannot divulge the investigation process and they said that new pictures would not change their findings. It was at this point they told me I could continue with getting an RMA, but that if the chip was found to be re-marked they **WILL** retain and confiscate it. The exact verbiage was, ""We do not disclose our investigation practices. If you believe your products are valid and wish to proceed with a return merchandise authorization (RMA), we can create one. **However, if the products fail the validation process, the units will be retained and confiscated, and no replacements or refunds will be provided.** For this reason, we are giving you the option to take the letter and share it with the place of purchase. This will give you more possibilities to get a replacement since you have the processors in your possession."" So, as you can see, they insisted I return it to Microcenter, so I did, and they graciously allowed me to return it for store credit.

Here are all the relevant pictures for 02096, including Intel's letter claiming it is re-marked, original receipt, warranty checker from Intel, retail box, IHS, serial number close-up, a screenshot of the email where they threatened to confiscate the CPU, and a screenshot of their initial response via email: [https://imgur.com/a/tC3AFFU](https://imgur.com/a/tC3AFFU)

The processor purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023, partial serial 03252:

Just like the last RMA, I filled out the form, they got back to me, said the CPU was indeed confirmed as faulty, asked for my information and pictures, I provided it all. They got back to me and quoted back the WRONG serial number (I provided the correct one in the original form and the picture CLEARLY shows 03252). They quoted that I was talking about 03262. They went on to explain that 03262 is a tray processor and not subject to retail warranty. They suggested that I take it back to the OEM. I got back to them and stated that they were talking about the wrong serial number. I clearly provided 03252. They got back to me and said that the image appeared to be a 6 instead of a 5. At this point I provided closer-up pictures of the serial number and IHS as well as a picture of the retail box showing the matching serial numbers and batch numbers. It was at this point they backtracked and said that 03252 was indeed a retail box. They said I can proceed with the RMA BUT that they were not confident that it would pass fraud validation. He then pointed out, and I quote: ""

We have reviewed the new photos you provided and will approve the return of the device marked ""03252.""

* **However,** we are not fully convinced that it will pass the incoming fraud inspection at our depot. We strongly recommend that you return the product to your place of purchase.
* Please familiarize yourself with the Processor Warranty Terms and Conditions, as well as the warning at the bottom of the warranty information page: [Intel Warranty Info](https://supporttickets.intel.com/s/warrantyinfo?language=en_US). Specifically, ""**Please be advised as part of Intel's ongoing efforts to prevent fraud in the marketplace, in the event the product you submit for warranty support is found to be re-marked or otherwise fraudulent product, Intel reserves the rights to retain the product and/or destroy such product as appropriate**.""

""

At least this time they said they reserve the right to retain or destroy it instead of saying they WILL. At this point I contacted Amazon to let them know what was going on. I can't stress how good Amazon is. They didn't even ask for any extra details or screenshots, they simply allowed me to return the CPU for a full refund to the original payment method despite being 9 months outside of the return window. Kudos to Amazon!

Here are all the relevant images for 03252: [https://imgur.com/a/fInP3bC](https://imgur.com/a/fInP3bC)

At the end of the day, it felt like Intel was grasping at straws. They pounced at the opportunity to claim that one of the CPUs was a tray product, citing a serial number that was never even provided. Then when that didn't pan out, they pivoted to claiming it was re-marked. When I pressed them, giving several pieces of evidence for why each one was indeed valid, they stated I could continue with the RMA process but then turned to threatening me with confiscation or destruction of my property if it didn't meet whatever their validation process (that they won't disclose) is. The odds of both of these being re-marked or not genuine seem extremely low. It's definitely a scare tactic. And even knowing this, it worked on me! This feels like extortion, scamming, you name it.

Anyway, I wanted to get all this out there. Everyone should know what they are doing!",5344,2024-08-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ei1zvm/intel_has_denied_two_of_my_14900k_rmas/,826,hardware

1dzakof,LTT response to: Did Linus Do It Again? ... Misleading Laptop Buyers,"Note: I am not affiliated with LTT. Just a fan that saw posted in the comments and thought it should be shared and discussed since the link to the video got so many comments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJrkChy0rlw&lc=UgylxyvrmB-CK8Iws9B4AaABAg

> LTT Quote below:

Hi Josh, thanks for taking an interest in our video. We agree that our role as tech influencers bears an incredible amount of responsibility to the audience. Therefore we’d like to respond to some of the claims in this video with even more information that the audience can use in their evaluation of these new products and the media presenting them.

*****

Claim: Because we were previously sponsored by Qualcomm, the information in our unsponsored video is censored and spun so as to keep a high-paying sponsor happy.


Response: Our brand is built on audience trust. Sacrificing audience trust for the sake of a sponsor relationship would not only be unethical, it would be an incredibly short-sighted business decision. Manufacturers know we don’t pull punches, and even though that sometimes means we don’t get early access to certain products or don’t get sponsored by certain brands, it’s a principle we will always uphold. This is a core component of the high level of transparency our company has demonstrated time and time again. 

Ultimately, each creator must follow their own moral compass. For example, you include affiliate links to Lenovo, HP, and Dell in this video's description, whereas we've declined these ongoing affiliate relationships, preferring to keep our sponsorships clearly delineated from our editorial content. Neither approach is ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ as long as everything is adequately disclosed for viewers to make their own judgments.

*****

Claim:  “Why didn’t his team just do what we did and go buy the tools necessary to measure power draw”

Response: We don’t agree that the tools shown in your video are adequate for the job. We have multiple USB power testers on hand and tested your test methodology on our AMD and Intel laptops. On our AMD laptop we found the USB power draw tool reported 54W of total power consumption while HWInfo reported 35W on the CPU package, and on our Intel system the USB power draw tool reported 70W while the CPU package was at 48W.  In both cases, this is not a difference where simply subtracting “7W of power for the needs of the rest of the laptop” will overcome.  You then used this data to claim Qualcomm has inefficient processors. Until Qualcomm releases tools that properly measure power consumption of the CPU package, we’d like to refrain from releasing data from less-accurate tests to the public. According to our error handling process this would be High Severity which,at a minimum, all video spots referencing the incorrect power testing should be removed via Youtube Editor. 

*****

Claim: Linus “comes across as overwhelmingly positive but his findings don’t really match that”

Response: In this section, you use video editing to mislead your viewers when the actual content of our video is more balanced.  The most egregious example of this is the clip where you quote Linus saying, “now the raw performance of the Snapdragon chips: very impressive- rivaling both AMD and Intel’s integrated graphics...” but you did not include the second half of the sentence: “...when it works”. In our video, we then show multiple scenarios of the laptops not working well for gaming, which you included but placed these results before the previous quote to make it seem like we contradict ourselves and recommended these for gaming. In our video, we actually say, “it will probably be quite some time before we can recommend a Snapdragon X Elite chip for gaming.” For that reason, we feel that what we say and what we show in this section are not contradictory.

*****

Claim: These laptops did not ship with “shocking day-one completeness” or “lack of jank”

Response: The argument here really hinges on one’s expectations for launches like this. The last big launch we saw like this on Windows was Intel Arc, which had video driver problems preventing the product from doing what it was, largely, supposed to do: play video games. Conversely, these processors deliver the key feature we expected (exceptional battery life) while functioning well in most mainstream user tasks. In your video, you cite poor compatibility “for those who use specialist applications and/or enjoy gaming” which is true, but in our view is an unreasonable goal-post for a new platform launch like this.  

*****

Claim: LMG should have done their live stream testing game compatibility before publishing their review

Response: We agree and that was our original plan!  Unfortunately, we ran into technical difficulties with our AMD comparison laptops, and our shooting schedule (and the Canada Day long weekend) resulted in our live stream getting pushed out by a week.

*****

Claim: LMG should daily-drive products before making video, not after. 

Response: We agree that immersing oneself with a product is the best workflow, and that’s why Alex daily drove the HP Omnibook X for a week while writing this video. During that time, it worked very well and lasted for over two work days on a single charge. If we had issues like you had on the Surface Laptop, we would have reported them- but that just didn’t happen on our devices. The call to action in our video is to use the devices “for a month,” which allows us to do an even deeper dive. We believe this multi-video strategy allows us to balance timeliness with thoroughness. 

*****

Claim: The LTT video only included endurance battery tests. It should have included performance battery tests as well. 

Response: We agree, and we planned to conduct them! However, we were frankly surprised when our initial endurance tests showed the Qualcomm laptops lasting longer than Apple’s, so we wanted to double-check our results. We re-ran the endurance tests multiple times on all laptops to ensure accuracy, but since the endurance tests take so long, we unfortunately could not include performance tests in our preliminary video, and resolved to cover them in more detail after our month-long immersion experiment.  

*****

Claim: The LTT video didn’t show that the HP Omnibook X throttles its performance when on battery

Response: No, we did not, and it’s a good thing to know. Obviously, we did not have HP’s note when making our video (as you say, it was issued after we published), but we could have identified the issue ourselves (and perhaps we would have if we didn’t run all those endurance tests, see above). Ultimately, a single video cannot be all things to all people, which is why we have always emphasized that it is important to watch/read multiple reviews. 

*****

Claim: When it comes to comparing the power efficiency between these laptops processors - when on battery that is - you need to normalize for the size of the laptop’s battery

Response: We don’t think normalizing for the size of a laptop’s battery makes sense given that it’s not possible to isolate to just the processor. One can make the argument to normalize for screen size as well, but from our experience the average end user will be far more concerned with how long they can go without charging their laptop.

Claim: LTT made assumptions about the various X Elite SKUs and wasn’t transparent with the audience. 

Response: As we say in our video, we only had access to laptops with a single X Elite SKU and were unable to test Dual Core Boost since we didn’t happen to get a machine with an X1E-80-100 like you did. We therefore speculated on the performance of the other SKUs, using phrasing like “it’s possible that” and “presumably.” We don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect a higher clocked chip to run faster, and we believe our language made it clear to the audience that we were speculating. 

Your video regularly reinforces that our testing is consistent with yours, just that our conclusions were more positive.  Our belief is that for the average buyer of these laptops, battery life would be more important than whether VMWare or Rekordbox currently run. We take criticisms seriously because we always want to improve our content, but what we would also appreciate are good faith arguments so that strong independent tech media continues to flourish.

1ekme22,AI cores inside CPU are just waste of silicon as there are no SDKs to use them.,"And I say this as a software developer.

This goes fro both AMD and Intel. They started putting so called NPU units inside the CPUs, but they DO NOT provide means to access functions of these devices.

The only examples they provide are able to query pre-trained ML models or do some really-high level operations, but none of them allow tapping into the internal functions of the neural engines. 

The kind of operations that these chips do (large scale matrix and tensor multiplications and transformations) have vast uses outside of ML fields as well. Tensors are used in CAD programming (to calculate tension) and these cores would largely help in large-scale dynamic simulations. And these would help even in gaming (and I do not mean upscaling) as the NPUs are supposed to share CPU bandwidth thus being able to do some real fast math magic.

If they don't provide means to use them, there will be no software that runs on these and they'll be gone in a couple generations. I just don't understand what's the endgame with these things.

1c8z2mh,"10 years is way too little for a digital device to become declared unsupported and handicapped artificially and by force
","I volunteer at a place where we restore old desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets and then forward them to people in need who can't afford them. Many of the Windows laptops are over 10 years old, up to 15 in some cases. Sadly, we can't afford the time to restore devices that are 20 years or older, but at least in theory, they could be brought back to life and be used.

On the tablet side of things, Apple or Samsung, things are different. A couple weeks ago, I had an iPad Mini 1st gen that was borderline useless. One no longer can update the software, download any apps, or use most of the provided apps. It can solely be used for browsing Wikipedia or watching YouTube videos in a horrendously low quality, 360 or so, while the screen is almost 1080p. The device looks like new, feels like new, the battery works fantastically, yet the device is relegated to e-waste because using it only for the camera and browser is something nobody really wants. If the people could at least download newer versions of YouTube, a game or a navigation system, the device could still be used.

Another case with Samsung as the representative of the Android side. ""Hurr durr Android freedom no walled garden""-BUUUULLSHIIIIT! The device is barely 10 years old and stuck on Android 4. You can't update the software, you can't update the apps, the apps refuse to work in their old versions, and you can't update the Playstore. The device is basically e-waste. THEORETICALLY you can install LineageOS or some other bullcrap, but doing that on an Android device is 4 times as difficult as installing Windows on a normal PC and nobody wants to deal with that crap except for the hardcore enthusiasts. The device is relegated to e-waste for NO REASON other than Samsung's greed, and Apple's greed, and general capitalist-corporate-greed.

What prompted me to write this rant was a random comment I stumbled upon while searching for a solution. The comment went something like ""There is no good reason to use an Android 4 device at \[current year\], move on and buy a new device.""

The degenerate morons like the commenter are the reason why modern devices suck, die way too soon, or are killed off by force; they are the reason why fighting climate change is an impossible task and why humanity is going to suffer a genocide executed by the fucking Sun; and I don't have any problem with calling that kind of people degenerate morons no matter who gets offended or thinks that that is ableist or a slur because that is what they fucking are - DEGENERATE MORONS.

There are many, many, many good reasons why you would want to use such an old device, and I will list some of them:  
you want to experience old games or video media in the way it was experienced in the past, similarly to why people still use MP3 players or record players;  
you want to experience using older versions of existing software for the thrill of it;  
you are actively using a software that no longer receives support but works on that device, but you don't want to deal with all your other apps not working (might disproportionally affect people with disabilities);  
you want to have a functioning backup device;  
you want to give an older device to little children or people with disabilities and not be sorry if they accidentally break it;  
you want to experiment with software and hardware on an older device so you are not financially ruined if you break it;  
and the most important of all: you don't want to create unnecessary e-waste when you can use a device that still fucking works.

Do I think companies should be forced to support a 10 year old device?

HELL NO! I can understand that companies need to innovate and earn money and sell new products. I want them to do that.

What I don't want them to do is to wall-off functioning devices so that is nearly impossible for casual users to install an OS. People still use Windows XP era machines (both with XP and other OSs, regardless if Windows or Linux distros) for various reasons, including creating backups, digitizing analog media, or for retro gaming.

Companies should be forced to unlock bootloaders and to make installing an alternative OS super-easy and even provide tutorials on how to do it once they decide that their old device is not making them money. Companies should be forced to provide documentation. Companies should provide minimal server infrastructure to update the software to the newest version or release the needed files to the public so we can store it somewhere else.

If a company can't provide the minimum of keeping an old device somewhat running after 10 years, if that is really the straw that will break the corporate overlord's back, then I not only don't care - I want that company fucking gone off the face of the Earth, never to be remembered again.",434,2024-04-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1c8z2mh/10_years_is_way_too_little_for_a_digital_device/,247,hardware

I've removed portions of the post that I had edited in with potential counter evidence from redditors that were trying to refute this or find a way to defend MSI last night during the time of the post. I get it, and I added it at the time for full disclosure, and if I'm being honest, I would have liked for Starlit to *not* be linked to MSI. I was actually hopeful that some of the ""evidence"" that was found would turn out to be correct and this was just some scammer impersonating the company. Since we have confirmation directly from MSI (see above) that Starlit is their subsidiary, and they do in fact sell MSI products on ebay in an official capacity, obviously there's no need to try to find a way to defend MSI. Whether you believe MSI's statement that the seller was able to access brand new inventory of items that are selling out instantly at retailers and etailers to sell on ebay for double the retail price due to an ""error"" is up to you.

8rlf2z,PSA: 4K 144 Hz monitors use chroma subsampling for 144 Hz,"(Crossposted from r/Monitors by request)

I'm seeing a lot of user reviews for the new 4K 144 Hz monitors, and it seems like everyone mentions that it looks noticeably worse at 144 Hz. I keep expecting these posts to say ""due to the 4:2:2 chroma subsamping"", but instead they say ""I'm not sure why"" or something like that, both on here and on various forums. It seems monitor companies have done their usual good job of ""forgetting"" to inform people of this limitation, as most of the early adopters are apparently unaware that it is not actually capable of full 4K 144 Hz even though the subsampling was mentioned in the Anandtech article a month or two ago. In any case, I want to make people aware of what chroma subsampling is, and that these first-gen 4K 144 Hz monitors use it.

 

**Chroma Subsampling**

Chroma subsampling is a method of reducing bandwidth by partially lowering the resolution of the image.

Imagine you have a 4K image; 3840 × 2160 pixels. Each pixel is composed of a RED value between 0–255, a GREEN value 0–255, and a BLUE value 0–255. You could imagine this 3840 × 2160 full color image as three separate monochrome images; a 3840 × 2160 grid of RED values, one of GREEN values, and another of BLUE values, which are overlaid on each other to make the final image.

Now, imagine that you reduce the resolution of the RED and GREEN images to 1920 × 1080, and when you reconstruct the full image you do it as if you were upscaling a 1080p image on a 4K screen (with nearest neighbor scaling); use each 1080p pixel value for a square of 4 pixels on the 4K screen. This upscaling is only done for the RED and GREEN values; the BLUE image is still at full resolution so BLUE has a unique value for every 4K pixel.

This is the basic principle behind chroma subsampling. Reducing resolution on some of the pixel components, but not all of them.

The description above, of reducing resolution by half in both the vertical and horizontal resolution, on 2 of the 3 components, is analogous to 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. This reduces bandwidth by one half (One channel at full resolution, and 2 channels at one-quarter resolution = same number of samples as 1.5 out of 3 full-resolution channels)

Full resolution on all components is known as ""4:4:4"" or non-subsampled. Generally it's best to avoid calling it ""4:4:4 subsampling"", because it sounds like you're saying ""uncompressed compression"". 4:4:4 means no subsampling is being used.

4:2:2 subsampling is cutting the resolution in half in only one direction (i.e. 1920 × 2160; horizontal reduction, but full vertical resolution) on 2 out of the 3 components. This reduces the bandwidth by one third.

 

**YCbCr**

Above, I used subsampling RGB components only as an example; ""RGB subsampling"" is pretty terrible and is generally not used in computer systems (it has been implemented in hardware in Samsung's PenTile phone displays, but other than that, it's not very common). In an RGB system, since each of the 3 components dictates the brightness of one of the primary colors, changing one of the RGB values affects both the hue and brightness of the resulting total color. Therefore, using one R, G, or B value on a neighboring pixel makes a very noticeable change, so subsampling would degrade the image by quite a lot.

Instead, subsampling is generally only used in combination with YCbCr. YCbCr is a different method of specifying colors, used as an alternative to RGB for transmission. Of course, physically speaking, every display generates an image using discrete red green and blue elements, so eventually every image will need to be converted to the RGB format in order to be displayed, but for transmission, YCbCr has some useful properties.

 

**What is YCbCr Anyway?**

People get confused about what YCbCr actually is; misuse of terminology all over the place adds to the confusion, with people incorrectly calling it a ""color space"" or ""color model"" or things like that\*. Generally, it is referred to as a ""pixel encoding format"" or just ""pixel format"". It is just a method for specifying colors. Really, it is an offshoot of the RGB system, it is literally just RGB with a different axis system. Imagine a two-dimensional cartesian (X-Y) coordinate system, then imagine drawing a new set of axes diagonally, at 45º angles to the standard set, and specifying coordinates using those axes instead of the standard set. That is basically what YCbCr is, except in 3 dimensions instead of 2.

If you draw the R, G, and B axes as a standard 3D axis set, then just draw 3 new axes at 45º-45º angles to the original, and there you have your Y, Cb, and Cr axes. It is just a different coordinate system, but specifies the same thing as the RGB system.

You can see how the YCbCr axes compare to the familiar ""RGB cube"" formed by the RGB axis set (RGB axes themselves not shown, unfortunately): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/YCbCr.GIF

(\*EDIT: the term ""color space"" is very loosely defined and has several usages. By some definitions, YCbCr could be considered a ""color space"", so it is not strictly speaking ""incorrect"" to call it that. However, in the context of displays, the term ""color space"" generally refers to some specific standard defining a set of primary color chromaticity coordinates/gamut boundaries, white point, among other things, like the sRGB or AdobeRGB standards. YCbCr is not a ""color space"" by that definition.)

 

**Why Even Use YCbCr?**

YCbCr is useful because it specifies brightness and color separately. Notice in the image from the previous section, the Y axis (called the ""luma"" component) goes straight down the path of equal-RGB values (greys), from black to white. The Cb and Cr values (the ""chroma"" components) specify the position perpendicular to the Y axis, which is a plane of equal-brightness colors. This effectively makes 1 component for brightness, and 2 components for specifying the hue/color relative to that brightness, whereas in RGB the brightness and hue are both intertwined in the values of all 3 color channels.

This means you can do cool things like remove the chroma components entirely, and be left with a greyscale version of the image; this is how color television was first rolled out, by transmitting in YCbCr\*. Any black-and-white televisions could still receive the exact same broadcast, they would simply ignore the Cb and Cr components from the signal. (\*EDIT: I use ""YCbCr"" here as a general term for luminance-chrominance based coordinate systems.)

Subsampling components also works much better in YCbCr, because the human eye is much less sensitive to changes in color than it is to changes in brightness. Therefore you can subsample the chroma components without touching the luma component, and reduce the color resolution without affecting the brightness of each pixel, which doesn't look much different to our eyes. Therefore, YCbCr chroma subsampling (perceptually) affects the image much less than subsampling RGB components directly would be. When converted back to RGB of course, every pixel will still have a unique RGB value, but it won't be quite the same as it would be if the YCbCr chroma subsampling had not been applied.

 

**Terminology Notes**

Since RGB-format images don't have luma or chroma components, you can't have ""chroma subsampling"" on an RGB image, since there are no chroma values for you to subsample in the first place. Terms like ""RGB 4:4:4"" are redundant/nonsensical. RGB format is always full resolution in all channels, which is equivalent or better than YCbCr 4:4:4. You can just call it RGB, RGB is always ""4:4:4"".

Also, chroma subsampling is *not* a form of compression, because it doesn't involve any de-compression on the receiving side to recover any of the data. It is simply gone. 4:2:2 removes half the color information from the image, and 4:2:0 removes 3/4 of it, and you don't get any of it back. The information is simply removed, and that's all there is to it. So please don't refer to it as ""4:2:2 compression"" or ""compressed using chroma subsampling"" or things like that, it's no more a form of compression than simply reducing resolution from 4K to 1080p is; that isn't compression, that's just reducing the resolution. By the same token, 4:2:2 isn't compression, it's just subsampling (reducing the resolution on 2/3 of the components).

 

**Effects of Chroma Subsampling**

Chroma subsampling reduces image quality. Since chroma subsampling is, in effect, a partial reduction in resolution, its effects are in line with what you might expect from that. Most notably, fine text can be affected significantly, so chroma subsampling is generally considered unacceptable for desktop use. Hence, it is practically never used for computers; many monitors don't even support chroma subsampling.

The reduction in quality tends to be much less noticeable in natural images (i.e. excluding test images specifically designed to exploit subsampling). 4:2:2 chroma subsampling is standard for pretty much all cinema content; most broadcast, streaming, and disc content (blu-ray/DVD) uses YCbCr 4:2:0 subsampling since it reduces the bandwidth for both transmission and storage significantly. Games are typically rendered in RGB, and aren't subsampled. The effects of 4:2:2 subsampling probably won't be that noticeable in games, but it certainly will be on the desktop, and switching back and forth every time you want to turn on 144 Hz for games, then turning it back down to something lower so you can use full RGB on the desktop, would be quite a pain.

 

**Interface Limitations - Why No Support for 4K 144 Hz RGB?**

Chroma subsampling has started seeing implementation on computers in situations where bandwidth is insufficient for full resolution. The first notable example of this was NVIDIA adding 4K 60 Hz support to its HDMI 1.4 graphics cards (Kepler and Maxwell 1.0). Normally, HDMI 1.4 is only capable of around 30 Hz at 4K, but with 4:2:0 subsampling (which reduced bandwidth by half), double the framerate can be achieved within the same bandwidth constraints, at the cost of image quality.

Now, we're seeing it in these 4K 144 Hz monitors. With full RGB or YCbCr 4:4:4 color, DisplayPort 1.4 provides enough bandwidth for up to 120 Hz at 4K (3840 × 2160) with 8 bpc color depth, or up to around 100 Hz at 4K with 10 bpc color depth (exact limits depend on the timing format, which depends on the specific hardware; in these particular monitors, they apparently cap at 98 Hz at 4K 10 bpc). These monitors claim to support 4K 144 Hz with 10 bpc color depth, so some form of bandwidth reduction must be used, which in this case is YCbCr 4:2:2.

Before anyone mentions HDMI 2.1, it's not possible to implement HDMI 2.1 yet. Only the master specification has been released. I know a lot of people seem to think that when the specification is released, we'll start seeing products any day now, but that's not the case at all. The specification is the document that tells you how to build an HDMI 2.1 device; the release of that document is when engineers *start* designing silicon that is capable of that, let alone displays that use that silicon. The DisplayPort 1.4 standard was released in the early 2016, over 2 years ago, and we're only just now starting to see it implemented in monitors (I believe it has been implemented on only 1 monitor prior to this, the Dell UP3218K). Also, there are no graphics cards with HDMI 2.1 yet, so it wouldn't help much right now on a monitor anyway.

The HDMI 2.1 compliance test specification isn't even finished being written yet, so even if you had HDMI 2.1 silicon ready somehow, there's currently no way to have it certified, as the testing procedures haven't been released by the HDMI Forum yet. HDMI 2.1 is still under development from a consumer perspective. The release of the main specification is only a release for engineers.

  

**DSC Compression - The Missed Opportunity**

The creators of these monitors *could* have opted to use **Display Stream Compression** (DSC), which *is* a form of compression, unlike subsampling; it reduces bandwidth, and the image is reconstructed on the receiving side. DSC is part of the DisplayPort 1.4 standard, but Acer/ASUS chose not to implement it, likely for hardware availability reasons; presumably no one has produced display controllers that support DSC, and Acer/ASUS wanted to rush to get the product out rather than implement 4K 144 Hz properly. Note that DP 1.4 supports up to 4K 120 Hz uncompressed and non-subsampled; they could have simply released it as a 4K 120 Hz monitor with no tricks, but that sweet 144 Hz number was calling to them I guess. They probably feel marketing a ""120 Hz"" monitor would seem outdated, and don't want to be outdone by competition. Such is life in this industry... Still, they can be run at 120 Hz non-subsampled if you want, no capability has been *lost* by adding subsampling. Just that people are not getting what they expected due to the unfortunate lack of transparency about the limitations of the product.

**EDIT: I forgot that these are G-Sync monitors.** This is most likely why the monitor manufacturers did not support proper 4K 144 Hz using DSC, dual cables, or some other solution. When you make a G-Sync display, you have no choice but to use the NVIDIA G-Sync module as the main display controller instead of whatever else is available on the market. This means you are forced to support only the features that the G-Sync module has. There are several versions of the G-Sync module (these monitors use a new one, with DisplayPort 1.4 support), but G-Sync has historically always been way behind on interface support and very barebones in feature support, so come to think of it I **highly** doubt that the new G-Sync module supports DSC, or PbP/MST (for dual cable solutions).

If this is the case, it's more the fault of NVIDIA for providing an inadequate controller to the market, than the monitor manufacturers for ""choosing"" to use chroma subsampling (it would be the only way of achieving 144 Hz in that case). However it is still on them for not simply releasing it as a 4K 120 Hz display, or being clear about the chroma subsampling used for 144 Hz. Anyway, we'll have to wait and see what they do when they release FreeSync or No-sync 4K 144 Hz monitors, where NVIDIA's limitations don't apply.

**UPDATE:** AMD_Robert has [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/8rlf2z/psa_4k_144_hz_monitors_use_chroma_subsampling_for/e0vfwhm/?context=8&depth=9) that current AMD Radeon graphics cards themselves do not support DSC. No official word on whether NVIDIA graphics cards support DSC. If not, then it certainly makes more sense why display manufacturers are not using it. In that case, the only way to support 4K 144 Hz RGB would be via a dual-cable PbP solution.

 

**DSC Concerns**

Before anyone says ""meh we don't want DSC anyway"", I'll answer the two reservations I anticipate people will have.

1. DSC is a lossy form of compression. While it is true that DSC is not mathematically lossless, it is much much better than chroma subsampling since it recovers almost all of the original image. Considering that in natural images most people don't even notice 4:2:2 subsampling, image quality reduction with DSC is not going to be noticeable. The only question is how it performs with text, which remains to be seen since no one has implemented it. Presumably it will handle a lot better than subsampling.

2. Latency. ""Compression will add tons of lag!"". According to VESA, DSC adds no more than 1 raster scan line of latency. Displays are refreshed one line at a time, rather than all at once; on a 4K display, the monitor refreshes 2160 lines of pixels in a single refresh. At 144 Hz, each full refresh is performed over the course of 6.944 ms, therefore each individual line takes around 3.2 microseconds (0.0032 ms), actually less than that due to blanking intervals, but that's a whole different topic :P
https://www.displayport.org/faq/#tab-display-stream-compression-dsc

> **How does VESA’s DSC Standard compare to other image compression standards?**
> 
> Compared to other image compression standards such as JPEG or AVC, etc., DSC achieves visually lossless compression quality at a low compression ratio by using a much simpler codec (coder/decoder) circuit. The typical compression ratio of DSC range from 1:1 to about 3:1 which offers significant benefit in interface data rate reduction. DSC is designed specifically to compress any content type at low compression with excellent results. The simple decoder (typically less than 100k gates) takes very little chip area, which minimizes implementation cost and device power use, and adds no more than one raster scan line (less than 8 usec in a 4K @ 60Hz system) to the display’s throughput latency, an unnoticeable delay for interactive applications.

 

**Conclusion**

I know the internet loves to jump on any chance to rant about corporate deceptions, so I suppose now it's time to sit back and watch the philosophical discussions go... Is converting to YCbCr, reducing the resolution to 1920 × 2160 in 2 out of 3 components, and converting back to RGB *really* still considered 4K?

Then again, a lot of people are still stuck all the way back at considering anything other than 4096 × 2160 to be ""4K"" at all :P (hint: the whole ""true 4K is 4096 × 2160"" was just made up by uninformed consumer journalists when they were scrambling to write the first ""4K AND UHD EXPLAINED"" article back when 4K TVs were first coming out; in the cinema industry where the term originated from, ""4K"" is and *always has been* a generic term referring to any format ≈4000 pixels wide; somehow people have latched onto the ""true 4K"" notion and defend it like religion though... But anyway, getting off topic :3)

These 4K 144 Hz monitors use YCbCr 4:2:2 chroma subsampling to reach 4K 144 Hz. **If you want RGB or YCbCr 4:4:4 color, the best you can do on these is 4K 120 Hz with 8 bpc color depth, or 4K 98 Hz with 10 bpc color depth (HDR)**.

Like I said, in natural images, chroma subsampling doesn't have much of an impact, so I expect most people will have a hard time noticing any significant reduction in image quality in games. However, it will be quite the eyesore on the desktop, and most people will probably want to lower the refresh rate so that you can use the desktop in RGB. And switching back and forth between pixel formats/refresh rates every time you open and close a game is going to get old pretty fast. Personally, I'd probably just run it at 120 Hz 8 bpc RGB all the time, that's perfectly acceptable to me. It's just unfortunate they opted to use subsampling as opposed to DSC to get the 144 Hz.

Anyway, this is just a friendly PSA, so hopefully fewer people will be caught off guard by this. If you're going to buy one of these 4K 144 Hz monitors, then just be aware that desktop and text will have degraded image quality when operating at 4K above 120 Hz (8 bpc/SDR) or 98 Hz (10 bpc/HDR). Or if you already have one of these monitors and are wondering why text looks bad at 144 Hz, that's why.",3270,2018-06-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/8rlf2z/psa_4k_144_hz_monitors_use_chroma_subsampling_for/,207,hardware
o1jvsy,"Logitech and other mouse companies are using switches rated for 5v/10mA at 3.3v/1mA, this leads to premature failure.","You might have noticed mice you've purchased in the past 5 years, even high-end mice, dying or having button-clicking issues much faster than old, cheap mice you've used for years.  Especially Logitech mice, especially issues with single button presses registering as double-clicks.

This guy's hour long video did a lot of excellent research, but I'll link to the most relevant part:

https://youtu.be/v5BhECVlKJA?t=747

It all goes back to the Logitech MX518 - the one mouse all the hardware reviewers and gaming enthusiasts seem to agree is a well built, reliable, long-lasting mouse without issues.  I still own one, and it still works like it's brand new.  

That mouse is so famous that people started to learn the individual part names, like the Omron D2F switches for the mouse buttons that seem to last forever and work without switch bounces after 10 years.

In some cases like with Logitech they used this fact in their marketing, in others it was simply due to the switch's low cost and high reputation, so companies from Razer to Dell continued to source this part for new models of mice they've released as recently as 2018.

Problem: The MX518 operated at 5v, 100mA.   But newer integrated electronics tend to run at 3.3v, not 5v, and at much lower currents.  In fact the reason some of these mice boast such long battery lives is because of their minuscule operating current.  But this is below the [wetting current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting_current) of the Omron D2F switch.  Well below it. Close enough that the mice work fine when brand new, or when operated in dry environments, but after a few months/years in a reasonably humid environment, the oxide layer that builds up is too thick for the circuit to actually register that the switch has been pressed, and the switch bounces.

Ironically, these switches are the more expensive option.  They're ""ruggedized"" and designed to last an obscene amount of clicks - 50 million - without mechanical failure - at the rated operating voltage and current.  Modern mice aren't failing because of companies trying to cheap us out, they're failing because these companies are using old, well-known parts, either because of marketing or because they trust them more or both, while their circuits operate at smaller and smaller currents, as modern electronics get more and more power-efficient. 

I know this sounds crazy but you can look it up yourself and check - the switches these mice are using -  [D2FC-F-K 50M, their spec sheet will tell you they are rated for  6v,1mA](http://en.chanlin-ele.com/Uploads/201601/568ce2c9eeda4.pdf).  Their wetting current range brings that down to 5v,100ma. Then you can get out a multimeter and check your own mouse, and chances are it's operating at 3.3v and around 1mA or less.  They designed these mice knowing they were out of spec with the parts they were using.",3010,2021-06-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/o1jvsy/logitech_and_other_mouse_companies_are_using/,591,hardware

j09yj5,POSCAP vs MLCC: What you need to know,"About the Author: I graduated with a B.S. Computer Engineering degree 10 years ago and haven't touched power electronics since then. I'm relatively uninformed, but **holy crap**, the level of discussion on POSCAPs vs MLCCs is so awful right now that this entire event is beginning to piss me off.

Power-delivery is one of the most complicated problems in all of electronics. Full stop, no joke. There are masters-degrees on this subject alone.

After this discussion, you still won't be able to make a GHz level power-delivery network, but maybe you'll at least know what engineers are thinking when these issues come up.

What's the big deal?
-------------------

Internet discussion around NVidia's new GPUs have reached maximum Reddit, and people, such as myself, are beginning to talk out of their ass about incredibly complicated issues, despite having very little training on the subject matter.
 
For a less joke answer: EVGA's GPUs are using more MLCCs, while Zotac is using more POSCAPs. Now people want to know MLCC vs POSCAP and whether or not they should return their Zotac cards.

A primer on electricity: **Don't ever run out of power**
---------------------

From high school, you might remember that electricity is delivered with Voltage and Current.  **Current** is the easy one: its a simple count of electrons. Current is measured in ""Amps"", which is exactly 6,214,509,000,000,000,000 electrons per second. Yes, an ""Amp"" is very literally the number of electrons that pass through a circuit per second. For some reason, Electrical engineers call current ""i"".

**Voltage** is harder to conceptualize, but is summarized as ""the energy per electron"". A singular electron at 100V will have 100x more energy than an electron at 1V. EEs call voltage ""V"".

Gravity is a decent example. A ""Rock"" doesn't have energy by itself, but if you put the rock on the top of a hill, it gains energy. But its not just gravity: if you put a rock in front of a bunch of explosives, the rock ""has energy"" (if you explode the explosives, the rock will move fast and the latent energy will become much more apparent).

So ""Voltage"" is a measurement of the ""unspent energy"" in an electron. If all your electrons lose voltage, its just like a rock at the bottom of a hill: you won't have any power from them anymore (not until you ""raise"" the rock to the top of the hill again). Or its like a bullet that doesn't have gunpowder anymore. In either case, voltage is the measurement of ""energy"" we can extract per electron.

The name of the game is ""Don't run out of power"". If at any point, your CPU, GPU, RAM, or whatever runs out of current (aka electrons) or voltage, you get corruption of some kind.

Power Supply, VRMs, etc. etc.
-----------------------------------

Power supplies, and VRMs too, convert power between different forms and ultimately are the source of power for circuits.

The PSU's job is to convert 120V power at 3 Amps into 12V power at 30 Amps, more suitable for your card to process.

The VRM's job is to convert 12V power at 30 Amps into 1.2V power at 300 Amps.

How does this work? Well, the PSU and VRMs have little sensors, constantly checking the voltage. If the voltage drops to 10V in the PSU, the PSU will deliver more Amps, raising the voltage back to 12. If the voltage grows to 14Vs, the PSU will reduce the current and hope that the voltage comes back to 12V eventually.

Same thing with VRMs, just at a different voltage/amperage level.

The most important thing about this process: PSUs and VRMs are **slow**. They only react **AFTER** the voltage drops down. To prevent a brownout (loss of power), you need to ensure that the circuit as a whole ""changes voltage slowly enough"" such that the PSU and/or VRMs have enough time to react.

What's a capacitor?
--------------------

Have you ever rubbed your hair with a balloon? When you ""move"" electrons to a location, they will physically stay there.

Capacitors are specifically designed devices that ""hold"" electrons. There's a magic differential-equation and everything (i(t) = C dv(t) / dt). The bigger the capacitor (C == capacitance), the more current (current is ""i(t)"") can be delivered with less change in voltage (dv(t)/dt).

TL;DR: **Capacitors store electrons**, or perhaps more accurately, they store electrons at a particular voltage. When current sucks electrons away, the voltage of the capacitor drops (and the remaining electrons have less energy). A bigger capacitor will drop less voltage than a small capacitor.

And #2: Capacitors are tiny. We can put dozens, or hundreds of capacitors under a chip. [Here's the NVidia 3080, and I'm going to zoom in 500% into the area under the chip](https://imgur.com/IEs64Ue).

Because capacitors are so tiny, you can place them **right next to a chip**, which means they instantly react to changes in voltage and/or current. Capacitors are so called ""passive"" components, the very nature of physics allows them to work instantly, but without any smarts (like VRMs or Power-supplies), they can't assure a particular voltage or current.

Capacitors simply ""slow down"" the voltage change due to currents. A passive, reservoir of energy that reacts faster than any active source can.

How much Capacitance are we talking?
------------------------------------

This is a bit of a tangent and more for people who are familiar with electricity already. Feel free to skip over this section if you're not into math or physics.

An NVida 3080 is specified to consume 300W+ of power. This will largely be consumed at 1.1 or 1.2V or so.  That's 250 Amps of current.

One of the POSCAPs in the [Zotac GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/QJIGuSTPDbCQ9i7k.jpg) is 330uF.

Given i(t) = C dv(t) / dt, we now have two of the variables figured out and can solve for the result:

250 Amps = 0.000330 * dv(t) / dt

Voltage swing of 757,600 Volts per second.

Oh yeah, we did that math correctly. ~750,000V voltage-swings per second. But remember, we're operating over a microsecond here: so over a microsecond, we'll only see a voltage-swing of .75V, which is still enough to cause a brownout. Even if your VRMs are at microsecond speeds, we're running out of voltage before they can react.

That's why there's so many capacitors under the chip: one capacitor cannot do the job, you need many, many capacitors working as a team, to try and normalize these ""voltage"" swings. These huge currents at very high frequencies (2GHz) are what makes PDN design for these modern CPUs or GPUs so difficult.

The Load Dump: The opposite issue
-----------------------------

Remember those PSUs and VRMs? They're sensing the lines, and suddenly see a .75V drop. Oh no! They immediately start to react and increase the electrons going down the pipe.

Wait a sec, it takes milliseconds before the energy actually gets there. Your 2GHz GPU (that's 0.5 nanoseconds, or 0.0005 microsecons, or 0.0000005 milliseconds) doesn't need all that energy anymore. Because the PSU / VRM reacted ""too late"", they've accidentally sent too much power and your voltage is now 500V and you've caught everything on fire.

I exaggerate a bit, but... yeah, that happens. This is called a ""[Load Dump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_dump)"" and its the opposite of a brownout. Capacitors also serve as reservoirs of excess electricity: storing excess current until the future when it can be used.

Because brownouts and load-dumps are opposites, they can be characterized by the same equation: simply called ""high frequency noise"". A 2GHz brownout or 2GHz load-dump looks the same to the board-designer, because the solution is the same... adding a capacitor that deals with that 2GHz (doesn't matter if its ""too much"" energy or ""too little"").

What matters is the ""speed"" of the noise: is it happening over a millisecond (Hz)? Microsecond (kHz)? Nanosecond (MHz)? Or fraction of a nanosecond (GHz)? And second: the magnitude: the bigger the noise, the harder it is to deal with (ie: more capacitance is needed to counteract).

Which capacitors are better? POSCAP vs MLCC? 
---------------

Okay, now we can finally get to the meat of this discussion.

**I don't know**.

Wut? 

Yeah, you heard me right. I don't know. And any engineer worth a damn will say ""I don't know"" as well unless they have a $50,000 10GHz oscilloscope on hand and spent a few hours debugging this 3080 issue and a masters-degree in power-engineering.

This shit is so complicated and so far out of my pay-grade, that seeing low-end Reddit discussions on the subject is beginning to bother me.

Before you pull out your pitchforks, let me explain myself a bit more: there are many, many, many issues that can arise during the design of a PDN. Instead of saying what is going on, I'll tell you some issues I'm familiar with (but you literally can spend years learning about all the intricate issues that may arise).

Issue #1 MLCC Selection Process
-------------------------

There are 755,004 MLCC capacitors available for purchase from Digikey. I repeat, there are Seven-hundred-thousand MLCC capacitors available from Digikey, all with different characteristics.

[There are general purpose MLCCs only suitable for MHz-level filtering](https://ds.yuden.co.jp/TYCOMPAS/ut/specSheet?pn=JMK212BBJ226MGHT++).

[There are cheap MLCCs that cost $0.003 each](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/samsung-electro-mechanics/CL05B103KB5NNNC/1276-1028-2-ND/3886686). Literally fractions of a penny.

[There are expensive MLCCs that cost $5.75 each](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/tdk-corporation/C5750X7S2A226M280KB/445-C5750X7S2A226M280KBDKR-ND/10415015).

There are multi-terminal MLCCs, there are ESL-optimized MLCCs (low-inductance), there are ESR-optimized MLCCs (low-resistance). There are high-temperature MLCCs, there are voltage-optimized MLCCs, there are leakage-optimized MLCCs.

""MLCC"" isn't specific enough to be worth discussing. X7R MLCCs have entirely different characteristics than Z5U MLCCs (yeah, ""which ceramic"" are you using? The different ceramics have different resistances, inductance, leakages, and ultimately different frequency characteristics). Murata has a completely different reputation than KEMET.

What I can say: [COG Dielectric MLCCs are **certainly** considered to be better than most other capacitors for high frequency noise](http://datasheets.avx.com/C0GNP0-Dielectric.pdf). But the ~22uF MLCCs we're finding on these boards are almost certainly the [cheaper X7R Dielectric, and are only probably only MHz grade](https://ds.yuden.co.jp/TYCOMPAS/ut/specSheet?pn=JMK316AB7106MLHT+). 

Issue #2 POSCAP selection process
------------------

POSCAPs are simpler than MLCCs, only 10,000+ available from Digikey. But same thing really: there are **many** different kinds of POSCAPs, and generalizing upon any attribute (be it price, ESR, ESL, or whatever) is ridiculous.

EDIt: [Melvinhans](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/j09yj5/poscap_vs_mlcc_what_you_need_to_know/g6pboc9/) notes that POSCAPs are Panasonic's brand of Tantalum-Polymer capacitors.

Or in ELI5 terms: this whole MLCC vs POSCAP discussion is similar to a discussion of ""Ford vs Truck"". The very characterization of the debate is already nonsensical.

Issue #3 Noise Frequencies
---------------------

I have a general idea of the frequencies of noise to expect. We probably expect a 75Hz noise (VSync), a 2GHz noise (clock), and 5GHz noise (GDDR6x). But the VRMs and PSU will also have noise across many different frequencies.

A capacitor, be it POSCAP or MLCC, can only really handle one frequency the best. [For this MLCC, its 2MHz](http://static6.arrow.com/aropdfconversion/d9e7de9c3706bd4e744d6b88a24aae0f60f652f2/lmk316ab7106mlht_ss.pdf).

Is the reduction of 2MHz noise useful? I don't know. Give me a few hours with a 3080 and a $50,000 oscilloscope and **maybe** I'll tell ya. (chances are: I also need 2 more years of college studying this crap to really know what to look for).

Maybe the 2MHz noise is coming from the VRMs. Maybe the solution is to fix your VRMs switching frequency. Maybe your power-supply has issues with 500kHz, and you need more capacitors to handle the 500kHz case.

Issue #4: The ""Team"" of capacitors
----------------------

Designing a capacitor-network suitable to handle low 75Hz noise, medium kHz noise, high MHz noise, and very high-GHz noise requires the use of many different capacitors. That's just the facts, and every piece of the team matters

All of these designs have many, many different capacitors of different sizes working together. If you thought analyzing **ONE** capacitor was insane, now remember the literal **HUNDREDS** of capacitors [that are under that chip](https://imgur.com/IEs64Ue).

Every, single, one of those capacitors changes the characteristics of the power-delivery network.

Where is the brownout? Are we even sure we're seeing a brownout?
--------------------

This all assumes that there's a high-frequency brownout happening on a 3080. What if the issue was more mundane? What if its just a driver issue? What if its a Windows bug? What if some games are buggy?  Does anyone even have an oscilloscope reading on the power network of the 3080?

Even **IF** we somehow magically knew that the 3080's power network was the issue, then we still have the problem of isolating which frequency is problematic. A 220uF POSCAP will be excellent at negating 5MHz noise that a smaller MLCC would be unable to handle.

But a 500MHz issue would probably be solved with more MLCCs. And not X7R MLCCs, you need NP0 or C0G MLCCs for 500MHz. (The chemistry of the MLCC matters)

Without knowing the frequency of the brownout, making a ""team of small capacitors"" (better with high-frequency noise) vs ""large capacitor"" (better with lower frequencies) debate is fully nonsensical.

TL;DR: anyone claiming POSCAPs are worse than MLCCs is full of shit. The issue is far more complicated than that.",2610,2020-09-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/j09yj5/poscap_vs_mlcc_what_you_need_to_know/,333,hardware
oqmq94,Games don't kill GPUs,"People and the media should really stop perpetuating this nonsense. It implies a causation that is factually incorrect.

A game sends commands to the GPU (there is some driver processing involved and typically command queues are used to avoid stalls). The GPU then processes those commands **at its own pace**.

A game can not force a GPU to process commands faster, output thousands of fps, pull too much power, overheat, damage itself.

All a game can do is throttle the card by making it wait for new commands (you can also cause stalls by non-optimal programming, but that's beside the point).

So what's happening (with the new Amazon game) is that GPUs are allowed to exceed safe operation limits by their hardware/firmware/driver and overheat/kill/brick themselves.",2389,2021-07-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/oqmq94/games_dont_kill_gpus/,439,hardware

13gvfzb,Nvidia is ignoring a 5+ year old bug that is fixed by reddit user from r/hardware,"Hey there. There is a bug preventing display sleep when gamepad controller/HID device is connected, and it is an old and apparently known one. 

There was a [thread back in 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/k8r49n/nvidia_overlay_prevents_display_sleep_with/) in this very own hardware subreddit with a solution to this and an [extensive blog post](https://details-of-note.blogspot.com/2020/12/nvidia-3-year-old-bug.html). 

Apparently its caused by NVIDIA share using Chromium Framework with a typo in the code. Its fixable by a powershell script provided by the blogpost author in 2020.

tbthjj,[PSA] Newer TP-Link Routers send ALL your web traffic to 3rd party servers...,"I recently enabled a DNS gateway to be able to see requests from my router, and network devices. Was surprised to find 80K + requests (in 24 hours) out to an Avira ""Safe Things"" subdomains `*.safethings.avira.com` (far more than any other server).

Digging into this more, I found that it is related to the built-in router security ""Home Shield"" that ships with newer TP-Link routers - [https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers](https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers)

Here is the kicker though, I have the Avira / Home Shield services completely turned off (I wasn't even subscribed to their paid service for it). The router doesn't care, and sends ALL your traffic to be ""analyzed"" anyhow. See this response from TP Link (towards bottom of review) from last year - [https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:\~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity](https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity) Update: I emailed reviewer to confirm TP-Link never updated him after.

I contacted support about this again, and was given a non-answer about how the requests are to check subscription status. 80K + requests a day to check subscription status? Why would it even need to do 1 single subscription check, if I'm not enabling any functionality that is behind a subscription paywall? Also the rate of requests is not constant, it is higher when my internet traffic is higher. To me this lack of consistent answer / response from TP-Link is as concerning as the requests themselves.

I'm not seeing much online about this issue, as I don't think many people realize it is even occurring (since traffic is outgoing straight from router, as opposed to an individual computer). Hoping to gain some attention on this issue and get a real answer / response from TP-Link about what exactly is going on here. As well as a **concrete timeline** and promise for a fix to stop these outgoing requests, when we aren't even using their anti-virus services.

Edit: Additional details, this is on their WiFI 6 AX3000 (Archer AX55) Router. From the XDA Review looks like this is also happening on their Deco series. If you want to easily check your own router, you can use any DNS Gateway ([NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/), [Cloudflare Gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/) Pi-Hole etc.) Just be sure to set the DNS servers under ""Advanced->Network->Internet->Advanced Settings"" because the DHCP DNS server setting will only apply to the devices inside the network, not the router itself.

Edit #2: I've also contacted Avira directly regarding the endpoints, in the hope that they'll be more straightforward than TP-Link about the purpose. Will update here when I receive a response. Update: Avira support got back to me and said they couldn't answer any questions because I'm not a paying customer. So they can collect data, for free, but not tell me what the data is...

Edit #3: If anyone knows of good industry contacts, who can dig into this more or get real answers, please send a message! I've seen GamerNexus brought up a few times, but don't see any contact method.

# Update: Temporary Fix!

Discovered this late, but in case someone gets here from Google, etc. I noticed that if I block the `*.safethings.avira.com` subdomains, then **reboot the router**, this seems to prevent it going into the retry-loops when DNS lookup fails. There must be a flag that is set in-memory if the first time the router is ever able to successfully contact the domains? Rebooting after blocking prevents this flag ever getting set. So without the retries involved, this hugely reduced the router CPU usage when blocking for me. The router is actually now attempting requests less than when not blocked at all.

# Beta Firmware Update

TP-Link has posted links to beta firmware that claims to fix the issue. Note:  It hasn't been verified whether the update actually reduces requests to Avira, or simply caches the DNS query (then makes requests directly to IP) - [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/)

# Press Release by TP-Link Korea

Thanks to /u/Lord_Buffum for sharing this - [https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/](https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/)

Essentially they say that the *frequency* (not existence) of DNS requests is a bug that will be fixed, but never explain  **WHY** the router needs to contact Avira with HomeShield disabled. To me this adds almost no reassurance or new info. We already knew Avira is used for HomeShield, and that DNS lookups to Avira are to get the IP address. What we don't know is 1) Why the requests are being made with the service disabled, and 2) What data is even being sent in the requests (and why). Translated relevant bits below -

1. TP-Link HomeShield uses AVIRA services to protect its customers' networks from cybersecurity threats. AVIRA is a global cybersecurity software company based in Germany, now a brand of the Norton LifeLock group ([www.avira.com](http://www.avira.com)).

>Because this service operates by accessing the AVIRA Cloud service, the router periodically checks the AVIRA Cloud IP address. The router sent a DNS query to check this IP address. In order for the router to continue to use AVIRA cloud services, ***it is necessary to periodically send DNS queries as it must be able to access AVIRA's IP***.  
>  
>However, as a result of examining the software, we found a defect in the DNS request logic where requests occur frequently, and our TP-Link has optimized the software to reduce such frequent queries. Customers will be able to update the firmware of these products soon.  
>  
>2. DNS query is to query a domain name, and send a DNS request to request the domain name of the AVIRA server.

>As a DNS query, no personal information is included in these requests.",2023,2022-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/,262,hardware

lk2f5i,BREAKING NEWS: 🚨 ADATA SX8200 Pro M.2 SSD performance has been DOWNGRADED by ADATA *AGAIN* in 2021!,"I am in the unique position of having purchased 3x ADATA SX8200 Pro 2TB drives at three different points in time. And I purchased all of them at the exact same retailer, using the exact same ADATA product number each time.

ADATA recently downgraded the hardware in October 2020, by using a slower controller and slower Samsung flash, angering a lot of people and making news headlines. ADATA were even contacted by Tom's Hardware and put out an official statement:

- https://www.tomshardware.com/news/adata-xpg-sx8200-pro-controller-change
- https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/jiwyut/adata_has_made_a_secret_revision_to_the_sx8200/

Unlike other people, I wasn't too upset by that downgrade (my 2nd order), since it was still fast enough and used quality Samsung flash which was still fast.

So I ordered a third one (order 3) thinking I'd get the same downgraded version.

NOPE. ADATA has found a way to downgrade it EVEN MORE while still charging the same high price for customers! They now use SK Hynix flash which is around -1000MB/s SLOWER than the Samsung ""downgrade"" flash! The decision makers at ADATA didn't even care about updating their TBW endurance specifications or their expected speeds when they continue downgrading these units. So I have no idea how long this slow and low-quality flash will last. And its new speed is NOWHERE NEAR the original specifications ADATA wrote for the SX8200 Pro back when it used quality flash memory.

Thanks a lot for being super awful and learning nothing from your previous scandal a few months ago, ADATA!

- DRAM: `Samsung DDR4 2048MB`

## Tools:

- CrystalDiskMark 7.0 64-bit, using ""Benchmarking profile: Default"".
- Identified flash and controller for Silicon Motion NVMe drives using the well-known ""smi_nvme_flash_id.rar"" from the tool author's own website at http://vlo.name:3000/ssdtool/ ([VirusTotal scan result](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2b798a6cc162abd3a66ccef80eb0e932af8be2350636c0e2eeff8eb989d8b764/detection) showing that Windows Defender has a false positive). The ""driver"" download is NOT required. Only the ID tool is needed. Alternatively, you can disassemble your computer and look at the SSD chips under a magnifying glass if you prefer the manual way of checking, hehe.
- AMD X570 (MSI X570 Unify motherboard) and Ryzen 3900x, so it's a high-speed PCIe Gen4 PCH bridge. Therefore whether I used the CPU or PCH connection method shouldn't matter much for performance. It may sway things by 1-2% at most according to PCH benchmarks I've seen. But all the other massive differences are entirely due to ADATA's different flash memory and controllers.

## Benchmarks:

- All images: https://imgur.com/a/PIr7FI0
- **Via PCH: SM2262EN with Micron 96L(B27B) TLC:** [December 2020, 97% full drive](https://i.imgur.com/hzTe5X1.jpg) / [February 2021, 94% full drive](https://i.imgur.com/Bib68jT.jpg). The fact that the drive is full is interfering with the speeds. Otherwise this would be the fastest in all metrics. When this drive was new (same computer, same PCH bridge), I was getting 3400-3600MB/s read and 2800-3000MB/s write, but I didn't save the benchmark images. Unfortunately I can't empty this drive to do an ""optimal performance re-test"" since it's my OS drive.
- **Via CPU: SM2262G with Samsung 3dv4-64L TLC:** [December 2020, empty drive](https://i.imgur.com/1avCduC.jpg) / [February 2021, 54% full drive](https://i.imgur.com/2sMOMNb.jpg). The performance loss in February is again related to this other drive being half-full now.
- **Via PCH: SM2262G with Hynix 3dv5-96L TLC:** [February 2021, empty drive](https://i.imgur.com/COyGTKz.jpg) / [Second benchmark to verify that it really IS that slow](https://i.imgur.com/59oZMJw.jpg). Very slow speeds on this brand new, empty drive. Sigh.
- Summary: ADATA SX8200 Pro is using very slow flash memory now, from a low quality manufacturer (SK Hynix is nowhere near the quality of Intel/Micron or Samsung). The low-quality flash they're using now is around 1000 MB/sec SLOWER than the Samsung flash from their previous ""downgrade"". Just compare the 2nd and 3rd drives in their ""empty drive"" state above. It's sickening. And their TBW/endurance value is no longer true, so we don't know how many write cycles this new flash will last.

What are people's thoughts? I'm thinking of bypassing my store and contacting ADATA directly to get a unit with Samsung or Intel/Micron flash. Or maybe I just return this slow SK Hynix flash garbage to the store and buy an SSD from another brand (if so, which)? What would you do?

The ADATA SX8200 Pro was once an amazing SSD (it was one of the best on the market), but is now just a basic SSD with bad performance that no longer matches its own price/value. It's now overpriced. Meh.

Ping: /u/NewMaxx from the previous scandal thread.

*Update: I decided to return all of these scamming ""bait-and-switch"" ADATA SSDs, only keeping the oldest, high-quality Micron flash unit from before all of their stealth downgrade behaviors began. I will be replacing the two scam units with two very high quality Samsung 970 Evo Plus instead.*",1681,2021-02-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/lk2f5i/breaking_news_adata_sx8200_pro_m2_ssd_performance/,258,hardware
iwebai,The LG OLED CX does not work properly with the RTX 3080. It chroma subsamples at 4k 120Hz. G-Sync is completely broken,"Hi,

This post is for everyone who has considered buying an OLED 4k TV from LG to game on with the RTX 3080. I'm not trying to get tech support here but rather try to get attention for this issue so LG or Nvidia will fix this.

I have recently bought an 48"" LG OLED CX for the 4k 120Hz HDR gaming experience on the RTX 3080. Since I haven't been able to get a RTX 3080 yet, a friend of mine brought his Zotac RTX 3080 over to my house to test and experience the 4k 120Hz TV. Well... it's been a pretty big disappointment. We experienced the following.

&#x200B;

* The LG CX will automatically chroma subsample at 4k 120Hz, meaning you will get 4:2:2 instead of 4:4:4. Everything is fine at 4k 60Hz. But at 4k 120Hz we noticed something is wrong with the colors. The chroma subsampling is clearly evident when looking at the borders of dark text. This is not some small issue because it pretty much ruins the 4k 120Hz experience once you notice it.
* 4k 60Hz, 1440p 120Hz seem to be 4:4:4 with no subsampling.
* We researched online and there are numerous reports confirming this chroma subsampling issue at 4k 120 Hz. (sources: [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/page-74](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/page-74), [https://hardforum.com/threads/lg-48cx.1991077/page-103](https://hardforum.com/threads/lg-48cx.1991077/page-103)) Apparently only the CX models are affected, for the C9 models 4k 120 Hz 4:4:4 is working fine. I couldn't find a single piece of evidence that the LG CX is capable of 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 with an HDMI 2.1 input.
* Since other TV models are not affected I doubt this is Nvidia's fault. It more points toward LG's side. When reading through the forums, it looks like this internal downsampling issue of an 4:4:4 input to 4:2:2 has been an issue for months, nothing has been done yet to fix it . It is even questionable if LG is aware of this and whether they will ever fix this.
* If this is a software bug and is fixable by LG, this might get fixed if we bring enough attention to it. However, if this is a hardware bug (meaning the LG CX has never been capable of 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 with HDMI 2.1) I highly doubt this will get fixed before PS5 release and release of Cyberpunk 77 (or ever). I have yet to see a single piece of evidence that the LG CX is even capable of 4k 120 Hz 4:4:4 ...
* G-Sync is completely bugged. We were forced to turn it off.

&#x200B;

Until this issue and the Gsync issue (which is most likely on Nvidia's side and will be fixed with the new driver update) is resolved, do not buy the LG CX if you are expecting a true 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 experience, it is not acceptable with the 4:2:2 issue and you should not spend 1.5k or even 2k+ USD/Euro on this TV until LG has fixed this.

&#x200B;

I have found a real image of a LG CX monitor with this issue from another forum that really shows how much a problem the chroma subsampling is  (4k 120Hz 10bit, all pictures taken by Sixi82 from the avsforum, I am not taking any credit for them and solely using them to help resolve this issue):

no subsampling:

You will especially notice this in PC mode when you play a game with text. The text just becomes a blurry, smeary mess at close distance, it's like having the wrong prescriptions for your glasses. At this price point 1.5k - 2.5k USD/Euro this is just unacceptable. There is no point of using this TV as gaming monitor if text becomes smeary at 4k 120Hz and even 100Hz and every other framerate other than 60Hz according to some in the forums.

Apparently LG decided to cut the HDMI 2.1 transfer rate from 48 Gbits/s to 40 Gbits/s. But still 40 Gbits/s is still enough for 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 HDR.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I just want to clarify why this issue should not be considered some small inconvenience for LG and Nvidia but rather an important issue that might decide over massive future revenues:

* The LG OLED CX will be a groundbreaking and a class definiting ""monitor"": first TV to support 4k 120Hz AND 4:4:4AND  G-Sync AND HDR. This has never been done before. Unlike other 4k OLED models this makes the LG CX perfect for gamers.
* Gaming on the LG OLED CX is from another world. Breathtaking colors, strong contrasts, low input lag. And all with features tailored towards gamers (G-Sync, high refreshrate). When i first tried the LG CX it opened my eyes. I had a matrix moment where I decided that I take the truth pill. I cannot ever go back to a non-OLED display. If you have never experienced that, you must try it, it is nothing like you have ever experienced.
* If this chroma subsampling issue and G-Sync issue is not resolved, this will definitely break the LG CX for gamers, it is nothing more than an ordinary OLED TV then.
* LG and Nvidia might potentially lose a huge market. I can totally imagine a future where gamer enthusiast's first monitor choice is an OLED monitor with G-Sync because it offers everything an IPS monitor has but with better colors, contrast, HDR and so on.
* The revenue and profit margins on the OLED monitors will be probably much higher than the current IPS/TN/VA monitors and might lead to a significant revenue stream for Nvidia and LG.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Things I have/others have tried to fix it:

* Switch HDMI cables. I have tried with 2 different HDMI 2.1 cables (50 Euro each) that support up to 8k 60Hz
* Switch between all kinds of different modes: SDR/HDR, PC Mode, 8 bit, 10 bit, done nearly everything.
* G-Sync seem to work again when going back to an older driver version with RTX 2000 or older series.
* Chroma subsampling primarily (or only) affects the LG OLED CX and becomes noticable at 4k 120Hz, 100Hz and 1080p 120Hz. 1440p 120Hz is fine.

I just hope we bring enough attention towards these 2 issues. They will either make or break the OLED gaming monitor. If this issues persist the OLED gaming monitor market will probably die in its infancy and will never recover.

Although the B9 and C9 models do not have the chroma subsampling issues (don't take my word for it), the current model and only not discontinued model, the CX, has this issue which makes it quite important to fix it quickly with all the new RTX 3080 owners who want to upgrade soon with Cyberpunk 77 and other game releases

&#x200B;

EDIT 3:

John Archer just covered these issues on Forbes

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2020/09/20/lg-oled-tvs-having-issues-with-latest-nvidia-rtx-30-graphics-cards/#513a5d57267a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2020/09/20/lg-oled-tvs-having-issues-with-latest-nvidia-rtx-30-graphics-cards/#513a5d57267a)

&#x200B;

EDIT 4: To counterclaim that the HDMI cable is the issue ([https://twitter.com/BigJohnnyArcher/status/1307760577775915008](https://twitter.com/BigJohnnyArcher/status/1307760577775915008)) : I think the strongest argument against that is that C9 has no subsampling whereas the CX subsamples with the same HDMI cable (DP to HDMI 2.1 adapter) and setup:

(see people who testet that: [/u/kasakka1](https://www.reddit.com/u/kasakka1/), [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113799](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113799) , [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113596](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113596) , [https://twitter.com/Sixi82/status/1307761189951336450](https://twitter.com/Sixi82/status/1307761189951336450))

EDIT 6: u/fanslo had a chat with LG support ([original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED/comments/ix2mcu/lg_chat_reply_regarding_lg_cx_4k_120hz_444_issues/)). The LG support stated that their engineers are working on it. They promised to either fix this with a firmware update or replace the TV if they can't solve the subsampling issue. I'm not sure, however, if this can be seen as a guarantee that LG will fix it or replace your TV or if this is just a standard answer.

EDIT 7: LG confirmed that they will roll out an update that will fix the G-Sync issues and maybe the subsampling issue (not explicitly mentioned). Yay. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DRWe-5o8s&ab\_channel=HDTVTest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DRWe-5o8s&ab_channel=HDTVTest).

An updated firmware has been in development with plans for a roll out within the next few weeks to LG's 2020 and 2019 HDMI 2.1 capable TVs, which should address these incompatibility issues. When ready, additional information will be available on the LG website and in the software update section of owners' LG TVs.

uno632,"Crypto is crashing, GPUs are about to be dumped on the open market","I've been through several crypto crashes, and we're entering one now (BTC just dipped below 28k, from a peak of 70k, and sitting just below 40k the last month).  

* I'm aware BTC is not mined with GPUs, but ETH is, and all non-BTC coin prices are linked to BTC.

**What does it mean for you, a gamer?**     

* GPU prices are falling, and will continue to fall **FAR BELOW MSRP**.  During the last crash, some used mining GPUs were around 1/4 or less below MSRP, with all below 1/2, as the new GPU generation had launched, further suppressing prices.      
* The new generations are about to launch in the next few months.


**Does mining wear out GPUs?**    

* No, but it can wear out the fans if the miner was a moron and locked it on high fan speed.  Fans are generally inexpensive ($10 a pop at worst) and trivial to replace (removing shroud, swapping fans, replacing shroud).

* Fortunately, ETH mining (which most people did) was memory speed limited, so the GPUs were generally running at about 1/3rd of TDP, so they weren't running very hard, and the fans were generally running low speed on auto.

**How do I know if the fans are worn out?**

* Manually walk the fans up and down the speed range, watching for weird behavior at certain speeds.

Today I tried powering it on; I could get to the BIOS, but there I couldn't change anything. Whenever I pressed any keys, it turned the background in the BIOS from blue to black. Nothing could be changed; not even saving and exiting worked. I thought maybe I needed to activate something or try changing the clock. It said something about the time being wrong at boot-up (CMOS battery?). The computer didn't boot further, either. Any tips on what I can do to save this PC from going to the trash? I would also appreciate any pointers for drivers or other help.

1jnq55t,Luckiest galvanic corrosion incident?,"Run a repair shop and honestly I want thoughts on what y'all think happened, but I'll give my synopsis on it first:

Computer came in for leaking loop and water everywhere, with a bonus failed pump. Custom built and MC and BB/GS turned them away. Still turns on. Dog hair everywhere, all water-cooling, 240 and 120 for gpu-cpu respectively sharing a pump. 5800x and 7900XTX

Teardown report:
Factor 1: tap/mineral water loop with a dye
Factor 2: floofy dog hair encased both rads
Factor 3: water line burst 🤷

End result of factor 1:
Nickel plating was eaten away to copper interior causing corrosion with something in the loop. Apparently it's nickel plated copper plates, copper rad, and nickel steel fittings but it doesn't check out somewhere. Regardless, the outcome is incredibly odd under the plate; water and dye has penetrated the copper plate to the GPU die and coated it, leaving only dyed thermal paste behind and a small leakage through the protective plate on the die's PCB. The thermal paste acted as a gasket to keep it from flowing to the rest of the GPU PCB. The fins are blocked with corrosion material and there's between 60 and 75 holes in the fin channels towards the GPU die. No holes on die side. Has anyone seen this before?

End result of factor 2: 
Pump failed likely due to overheating with inadequate airflow over the rads and the 7900's heat. Thinking the heat may have caused a crack somewhere on the plate during thermal cycles to cause the water to seep through the plate, but just my theory. 

End result of factor 3: water coated the entire PSU, missed every component but the PSU except a drop on the edge of the mobo that spread to 1mm from crossing and shorting the CMOS clear button and 2 USB headers. 

My questions:
1. Has anyone seen this copper plate penetration before like this?
2. I'm unsure if anyone knows much about PWM water pumps and failure conditions, but would the pressure ramp during failure to cause it to leak if a fitting wasn't correctly installed? I know the actual head pressure on these pumps doesn't exceed more than like 2.3 ft (or meters I forget :c) of column height so why just burst during a failure event? 
3. Wtf?

Damage report:
-No dead components, not a single one
-Improper part installation on a few small things

Recommendations:
New loop
PCB cleanup
Filter cleaning schedule

Any thoughts? Wtf?",10,2025-03-31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jnq55t,0,computers
1jpguhp,90s Computer Runs but Doesn't Display - Compaq Deskpro PD 1000,"Computer History:  
My family has an old desktop that hasn't been used since the late 2000s. During that time, it's been collecting dust in my garage. I wanted to boot it up to recover some old pictures and see if I could run old games that won't run on modern computers.

Problem:  
When I start up the computer, everything appears to be functioning and I can hear the various parts running. However, I cannot get the computer to display anything onto my monitor. I also noticed that the hard drive makes a weird noise when the computer boots up.

Things I Tried:  
1.) I cleaned everything with an air compressor to get rid of all the dust.  
2.) I restarted the CMOS by holding the button down (for 10 seconds) on the motherboard while the computer was off and had been unplugged for a few minutes.  
3.) I removed the CMOS lithium coin battery (for 5 minutes) off the motherboard while the computer was off and had been unplugged for a few minutes.  
4.) I installed a new lithium coin battery.  
5.) Using two different monitors (both DELL, relatively new, not CRT monitors)

1jr882i,Windows 11 and Bitlocker locked me out of my drive,"So after upgrading my HP laptop to Windows 11, my secondary SATA SSD became inaccessible. (The system drive is an M.2 NVME and that worked fine.) Some of my previously connected USB external drives also encountered the same error:

*""Device settings for were not migrated from previous OS installation due to partial or ambiguous device match.""*

The USB drives worked fine on any other computer, so I backed up the content, formatted them on my HP and then copied back everything and they work just fine ever since. (There was no other workaround. I spent several days trying all versions of all drivers available for my system, but I couldn't fix the migration issue. It fixed my SD card reader and my Logitech mouse, but not my hard drives)

My secondary drive (SATA SSD) was a different story though. The Windows 11 update automatically enabled bitlocker on it and since I was using the laptop with a local account only, i didn't have any key or passcode to unlock it for use on another computer or on a Linux system. (Parted Magic couldn't access the drive)

So I got a catch 22 situation: the drive was only accessible by Windows because Bitlocker, but I couldn't access the partition in Windows because of the migration issue.  

Bitlocker couldn't be disabled, because the migration issue triggered exception 0x80070015 (device not ready) on all commands issued in Powershell. I couldn't enable AutoUnlock because of the same issue. 

I tried several software trying to access the drive. Several could access the partition but it was a mess, without the proper folder structure. Finally I was able to access it with DiskGenius and copy everything off to an external drive. 

TLDR: Don't upgrade to Windows 11 without a Microsoft account, because if something goes wrong, Bitlocker can lock you out from your data. ",5,2025-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jr882i,24,computers

I don't know what he did to it, intentionally or unintentionally, but I would like some help. I have uninstalled and reinstalled every network adaptor, restarted my pc, done a network reset....none of it has worked. Would a factory reset most likely fix the issue? I would like to know bc Ik a factory reset will uninstall every game I have and 
A. The wifi where I live is slow so those are painstakingly slow to reinstall, borderline impossible and 
B. I would like to know so I can continue using my computer at half functionality for videogames at least while I wait to save up money to buy a new one. 

I don't even seem to see an adaptor for wifi. Is it possible my bf stole the wifi card out of my computer while I left it there? He stole my simcard today and lied about it for a bit before giving it back so I don't put it beyond him at all. He thinks he has a right to steal my things because he blames me for stuff that the neighbors steal from his place, because he is convinced I know/am in contact with his neighbors and have been payed off by them and/or am being drugged with scopolamine by them. How likely is it for a factory reset to fix this?

Initially there was an Aerocool PSU, after some time of use a problem with starting the PC began, it did not turn on with the first press of the power button. The backlight blinked for about a second, the screws also started and everything went out, it turned on with 5-10 presses. 4 weeks ago the main thing happened, during the game a black screen appeared, the sounds of the game were heard for some time, and the fans in the case turned on to maximum. Then this began to happen at any time, a minute after starting the PC, or after 2-3 hours. I thought that the PSU was dying and could not handle the video card, decided to change it to MSI MPG A850G PCIE5.  
As a result, the problem with starting the PC was solved, but the black screen did not go away, this happens even when I go to the BIOS, literally 1-2 minutes there, black screen, screws to maximum.

I look for solutions online, they all require using the console which I can't because, well, the screen is black.

After that experience I started thinking that it would be great to change my main laptop's OS to linux, however this laptop has a few issues that makes me wonder if the process of migrating will be as smooth as it was with the old one. 


These are the laptop specs:
Asus GL552VW

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz   2.59 GHz

RAM 32.0 GB 

64bit OS

Integrated graphics: Intel core i7

Dedicated graphics: Nvidia Geforce GTX 960m

  
Now, the issue comes here. My laptop had a BSOD problem because of the Nvidia graphics card, whenever is booted, after a while it gave a BSOD unless the Nvidia card was disabled. I essentially can't use the card, can only work with the intel one. I took it to a specialist, but they said the procedure to fix the card was unlikely to work and expensive, so I just decided to leave the card disabled. We never determined if it was a hardware or software issue.

I'm worried this Nvidia card is going to cause trouble when trying to migrate to linux and Im not that linux saavy to confidently install the whole thing properly. The first time I did it with Kubuntu I had a very user friendly tutorial, but I doubt it will suffice for my situation.

1jpggnu,Debian 11 to 12 upgrade > Now no DNS resolution possible,"Heya,

yesterday I've upgraded one of my Debian VMs from 11 to 12 following the official guide: [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUpgrade](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUpgrade)

Everything went smooth, VM still boots (thankfully) and nothing appears to be broken... except for DNS. I simply get a `Destination Host Unreachable` when I try to ping any external address.

Doing a traceroute I get the following...

    traceroute to google.com (142.250.186.174), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
     1  Debian-Docker1.local (169.254.93.128)  3074.052 ms !H  3074.022 ms !H  3074.002 ms !H

The 169 address makes me believe it can't properly get an IP address itself or ""doesn't detect it properly"" for lack of better words? Running `ip a` I do get the correct internal IP assigned to the machine of `10.0.0.XX` on the interface `ens18`.

Also, while writing this I noticed... the above given 169 address seems to correspond to a network interface called `veth8c23c42@if2`, so... a virtual network? Maybe Debian believes this is the ""main"" interface somehow?

Bit stumped here right now 😅 Thanks already for your help!

# Update 1

Might have found something.

In `/etc/network/interfaces` there was a wrong default interface set, I think `ens192`, but my main interface is (now?) `ens18`... not sure why this changed.

Checking `ip route` I also had a default route with the `veth` interface instead of `ens18`, deleting that results in DNS working for the running session, however rebooting the machine breaks it again...

So I'm a bit further now but still not entirely there :)",3,2025-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1jpggnu/debian_11_to_12_upgrade_now_no_dns_resolution/,3,linux4noobs

1jnqoul,Can't connect to Windows VM from Ubuntu using FreeRDP; Error 104,"I switched over to Ubuntu (22.04 LTS) from Windows 11 about a month and a half ago and have been limping along as a full time college student using a new laptop and new OS during the school year. I use the Office 365 products a *lot* (particularly Word, OneNote, and Outlook) and the browser versions are terrible imo and don't have full functionality. I need to be able to use the actual full apps, and so I found [WinApps ](https://github.com/winapps-org/winapps)quickly after deciding to try switching to Ubuntu. I've got the Windows VM container set up using Podman (`podman-compose` specifically), with set username (here will be USERNAME) and password (here will be PASSWORD) following the GitHub instructions. But every time I try to RDP into it with FreeRDP using the `xfreerdp3` command, I've been getting errors. I've solved all of them through trial and error except this one: `BIO_read returned a system error 104: Connection reset by peer` . I have no idea what's going on nor how to fix it. I even removed the Windows VM and made a new one to make sure the password is correct, but I still am getting this error.

I start a new quarter tomorrow (Monday) and *really* need to get this figured out so I can access my notes (in OneNote). I've hit all dead ends by myself and really need help getting this working!

the newest one 570.133 and an older one manually and via the software updater.
• different kernels
• switching between X11 and Wayland 
• blacklisted neaouveueueueeu?
• safe boot deactivated. 
• fresh install of zorin OS core 17.3 as well as Kubuntu.

Hi, sorry for asking this even though I know there are many answers out there — but I’m really stuck and nothing is working for me.

I recently got interested in Linux and tried out a few distros like Nobara, Pop!_OS, and Mint.
Linux has been great so far, but I’ve run into a weird issue.

When I try to create a Windows installation USB using tools like Ventoy, balenaEtcher, or WoeUSB (on my Linux machine), I keep running into problems during the Windows installation.
Despite multiple attempts, I’m always facing the same issue.

Error msg : 
a media driver your computer needs is missing this could be a dvd usb or hard disk driver = during windows 10 installation 

And similar error during windows 11 installation also

Could Linux have changed something like the disk format or bootloader that’s preventing me from reinstalling Windows?

I’m still a beginner and just wanted to explore Linux. Now I’m confused about why I can’t go back to Windows.
I don’t mind losing my data since I already have a backup — I just want to reinstall Windows successfully.

Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!

1jqynil,"Brand new to linux, a couple issues that I couldn't find any info on","Hey everyone, yesterday decided to switch to Linux as my main operating system, dual booted with Windows for Adobe apps and unsupported games.

I am using Debian 12 with the XFCE desktop environment. So far, pretty much everything has worked fine, and I've been able to fix most of my issues with a quick Google search. However, there are a couple things that I couldn't find any info on:

1. Mouse sensitivity  
For whatever reason, my mouse feels noticeably slower than it does on Windows. My mouse does not require any proprietary drivers, and the DPI is set to 1600, yet it feels slower. Acceleration is set to 0 in the XFCE settings, but there is no sensitivity slider for some reason. Is there any way that I can just tell it to use the raw input of my mouse?  
Or could this be something to do with display scaling? I have a rather odd setup with one 4K monitor and one 1440p. Both monitors are set to 1x scaling though.

2. Audio settings  
This one is less important to me, but I'd still like to try to sort it out. There doesn't seem to be any way to specify a bit depth or sample rate in the XFCE audio settings. Is there any way to do this? I know it doesn't really matter unless you have specific files that support higher bit depths and sample rates, but I just like to know that I'm getting the best out of my hardware. After all, I am able to change this setting easily on Windows.

Overall I am enjoying Linux so far, it honestly feels snappier despite my PC being plenty powerful enough for Windows

1jpk1zu,Why is any Linux distro slow for me?,"Hello everyone, I was really eager to switch to Linux permanently. The problem is that no matter which distro I try to install, it runs slowly. My PC is an Asus TUF Gaming A15 (2023) with a Ryzen 7 7735HS, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and an RTX 4060.I've tried everything. The GPU drivers work correctly since I don't experience any performance drops. I can work well in Blender, and I tested The Finals, where I even get more FPS than I did on Windows.The issue is with application startup times—they are way too slow. Even opening the terminal, settings, or Google Chrome takes an unusually long time. No matter which distro I try, even right after formatting, the system feels sluggish, making the overall experience frustrating.I've also tested much lighter distros, and even Fedora, but the same exact issue persists. However, as soon as I switch back to Windows, applications launch quickly again.I'm really frustrated because I want to switch to Linux, mainly because of RAM usage—on Windows, I easily hit 70% usage with the software I use.

Any advice?",2,2025-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1jpk1zu/why_is_any_linux_distro_slow_for_me/,39,linux4noobs

1jsblpe,Feel too stupid to fix wifi issue on Debian bullsye on my raspberry pi :(,"Context: I have a raspberry pi 4 b running Debian bullsye; it's in a deskpi pro enclosure.

Up until yesterday, it was working just fine, connecting to my wifi, recognizing bluetooth devices, etc. After changing the hostname, (which I did through the desktop menu --> preferences --> raspberry pi configuration --> change hostname), the bluetooth stopped working (upon scanning for devices, it wouldn't find anything).

Shortly after that, I manually turned wifi off. (as in, on the wifi icon on the desktop, I selected ""turn off wifi""). After that, I could no longer connect to any wifi networks (could turn wifi back on, but upon trying to connect to any network, it just would never connect).

I spent many hours yesterday pouring through troubleshooting info, but apparently am too stupid to figure out what to do. Looking at `ip link`, showed the wlan0 in state `DORMANT`, and `eth0` in state `DOWN`. Doing `sudo ip link set wlan0 default` had no impact. `nmcli`showed `wlan0` state as disconnected. Tried connecting to my wifi network via nmcli, with `nmcli device wifi connect <AP name> password <password>`, kept getting an error ""Secrets were required, but not provided"", even though the passwords were correct. Googling for this issue, sent me down an endless rabbithole of fixes that did not apply to me. I restarted my router too, this did not help. (Also of note: I checked `/etc/hosts/` and `/etc/hostname/` and the entries were correct.)

I gave up and wanted to re-install the OS, but apparently am too stupid to even figure out how to do that (it appears the OS might be installed on an SSD in this enclosure, so flashing an OS to an SD card is of no help, as I can't get it to read from that, even though the boot menu is set to read from an SD card...)

There is such an endless world of troubleshooting info for wifi problems on linux that I literally don't even no where to begin. In trying to troubleshoot, I believe i Only made things worse... Ready to give up on using this, and throw it on the endless pile of failed projects in my life.

FYI , I also wonder if having docker on here screwed things up? I don't know.. That and changing the hostname are the only things I can think of that I did. I was having a lot of networking difficulty prior to this (couldn't ping the raspberry pi from another device on the network, even though it was connected to wifi; ssh into the pi only worked intermittently..)",2,2025-04-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1jsblpe/feel_too_stupid_to_fix_wifi_issue_on_debian/,5,linux4noobs

1js0e17,"So I want to share flameshot fix on wayland, that works for me. Try it yourself too!","Hello, recently I was using grim with slurp (i hate it so much, it has too less things I can do with screenshots), I'd rather use flameshot instead of grim&slurp. So the thing to fix my ""pain"" was to enter in fish config `set XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP ""Sway""`. Bc flameshot works on Sway. If I wanted to launch it in terminal it works great, in ANY shell. But if using nu and launch as `nu -c ""commandHere""` it wasn't really working (outside terminal). So tried like this on fish, worked great. So I came up with thought that `fish -c` not only runs command but also it launches with env vars from config file. Of course set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` properly for wayland. And yeah it works for me even on Hyprland and other ones too. I also use nushell so I use `fish -c` as the one to launch the flameshot, and I am not sick about any problems that I need to set some env var to other value, I have fish for executing and nushell as daily use.

So in short:  
fish config: `set XDG\_CURRENT\_DESKTOP ""Sway""` and if you need to `set QT_QPA_PLATFORM ""wayland""`

And you can use `fish -c flameshot` for executing the flameshot to screenshot.",2,2025-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1js0e17/so_i_want_to_share_flameshot_fix_on_wayland_that/,1,linux4noobs

Wrote the ISO onto a new USB with Rufus. 
Disabled secure/fast boot…as well as disabled fast boot via power settings within windows. 

Changed the USB to boot option 1 in boot settings (priority to place 1st also). Saved, shutdown, boot. Only for it to stay frozen at the splash screen. Same if I try from system->recovery->use device->select bootable usb. 

Disabled quiet boot to get the boot page vs the splash screen. No error messages. 

I’ve tried different ISO’s. Tried cleaning with diskpart, and reformatting. Tried different USB’s. Tried different USB ports. Tried writing the iso as DD image as a “why not” per the suggestion in Rufus. 

I consider myself not entirely incompetent, but I know when it’s time to ask for assistance. I’m assuming windows is c*ckblocking me somehow, or I’m missing something obvious, so any insight would be appreciated.

1jrbeo7,Help with Lidm Display Manager and DWM Setup on Devuan (OpenRC) – Defaults Not Working and Xterm Issues,"Hey everyone! I recently got a new laptop and decided to experiment with a minimal Linux setup. My goal was to build everything from scratch, using as few resources as possible (though I’m not sure I’m succeeding—200MB RAM at boot? Maybe I’ll tackle that later).  

I wanted a lightweight, terminal-based display manager instead of the usual graphical ones. After failing to install *Lemurs* (no luck with dependencies or guides), I settled for **Lidm**. I managed to compile Lidm without issues, and it runs fine when launched manually from the terminal. However, I’ve hit two roadblocks:  
1. **Setting Lidm as the default display manager**: No matter what I try, it doesn’t stick.  
2. **Launching DWM (my usual window manager) via Lidm**: It fails silently.  

As a workaround, I added DWM to my `.bash_profile` to start after login. But now, when DWM launches:  
- I can’t run any commands in the terminal.  
- An **xterm window** appears (no idea how it got installed). If I kill xterm, DWM crashes entirely.  

**System details**:  
- OS: Devuan 64-bit (OpenRC)  
- Using `doas` instead of `sudo` (I switched after trying Alpine Linux briefly). Not sure if this matters, but `doas` feels quirky compared to sudo.  

Any advice on:  
- Configuring Lidm as the default display manager?  
- Fixing the DWM/xterm weirdness?  
- Whether `doas` could be causing hidden issues?  

*P.S.* I speak Spanish and Esperanto, so apologies for any broken English. Thanks in advance!
Oh, and one last thing, could you recommend some applications I should have on my Linux system? I was thinking of installing the FreeBasic compiler, FreePascal, and Latin-language compilers, as well as other applications like LibreWolf, LibreOffice, Retroarch, Nvim, Tmux, KdenLive, Krita, Gimp, VLC, and so on. But I wanted to know about some terminal applications I might be interested in, or, I don't know, anything else.


Update thanks to user ""yerfukkinbaws""
The command I have in bash_profile is
""if [[ ""$(tty)"" = ""/dev/tty1"" ]]; then
pgrep dwm || startx
fi""

(Fun fact: It took me a while to update this because I tried to copy the text with Vim. I couldn't, and ended up using LibreOffice to copy the text.)

Regarding applications, and not just terminal applications, you can recommend anything: games, audio players, things like that. I just want to know about applications that I may not have known about and that might be interesting to me. Regarding my Linux distribution using 200Mb when starting up, well... yes... it's light, and I understand that, but I wanted to see what the minimum was and that it would be usable. I mean, I had heard that Antix Linux only needed like 64Mb of RAM (to half function, web browsers and other things I know that's a lost cause) but that, I simply want the minimum, because although my computer has 8Gb of RAM and of course it's not that it suffers from RAM, sometimes I have a friend who has a pretty bad computer and he would like 1Gb of RAM to be more than enough for everything. If it can be optimized, then it is optimized. I mean, after all, I try to install from a very clean and minimal version of Devuan (I would have used Artix, but configuring the wifi is torture, I know I could use an Ethernet cable, but I'm not going to spend money on a cable that I won't use later for personal reasons).

Another update, I realize I didn't install any audio drivers, and I don't know how to install them. What I did was: ""doas apt-get install pulseaudio pavucontrol."" Can anyone tell me how to configure it? I thought installing it would work, but now it doesn't.

Looking at things more closely, I think one of the errors I have could be related to this file ""etc/init.d/lidm"" this is its content:
#!/usr/bin/openrc-run

I'm running Linux Mint and I love it, but I'm really struggling with my audio. As a guitarist, I need to play the guitar and also record it at home.

I managed to get a guitar plugin work via Wine, but I've spent so many hours getting recording work I'm getting very frustrated. Installing / uninstalling JACK, Pipewire, whatever, and I can't get it working.

I would also like to play games via Steam and in Mint, that just seems to work.

In theory, I should be able to make audio work in Mint, but as a complete Linux noob I just can't seem to succeed in that. Would, let's say, Ubuntu Studio be good for gaming as well? Or some distro, that uses Pipewire as default? ZorinOS with some integrated Wine-stuff, if I remember correctly? Would some other beginner-friendly distro be more optimized for my use out-of-the-box?

I know how to do it with Macrium Reflect on windows, but I want to learn how to do this on Linux. So far I am struggling to do this using Gnome-Disk-Utility.

As said, I have a 750gb hard drive (with 150gb stored), a 500gb ssd, and an external hard drive enclosure so I can attach the hard drives via usb, and the program Gnome-Disk-Utility. Since the enclosure only has 1 slot, I put the 750gb drive into enclosure, used Gnome-Disk-Utility create an image of the 750gb drive, and then stored it on my main computer. The issue occurred when I tried to put that image onto the 500gb ssd, as it simply says the drive is too small and it doesn't give me the option to resize the image. I'm used to macrium reflect giving me the option to resize the the disk image during the final transfer step.

I have tried to resize the image itself by mounting it using Gnome-Disk-Utility and resizing it like a normal disk, but the options to resize the image are greyed out (I assume it is only mounted as Read Only). The only option I see is to resize the original disk itself before making the image, but I would prefer to only mess with the disk image to have less of a chance of permanently losing data.

I'm still new to linux itself, so I would prefer gui options where possible.

I don't really want to be in a position of dual booting. In my research, I've found there are decent options for running a single windows app with compatibility, but is there anything that would allow something closer to a virtual machine in a window?

Might have the wrong terminology for it. A window that is running a desk top, ideally with the microsoft user account logged in to have access to the work onedrive in the desktop file structure and not having to upload/download all the time.
