I would definitely try cleaning all the fans and filters, repasting the CPU, and maybe making sure that the airflow through the case makes sense - you generally want front/bottom intake and rear/top exhaust. 

It's a pretty easy job to do yourself. A little thing of thermal goop costs like ten bucks and is enough for 3-4 CPUs. Just take it off and clean both sides (dry paper towel should suffice) and put a little paste on the CPU (Noctua recommends a 5 pattern like on dice, but really anything is fine, the mounting pressure spreads it). While you're at it, make sure there is no protective film left on the CPU cooler. 

For fan cleaning you can just use compressed air or a vacuum cleaner, but make sure to hold the fan blades in place, if you let them spin freely, you can damage the bearings or generate electricity that could potentially harm your motherboard.

For checking airflow, most fans have an arrow printed on the side - but if not, check the shape of the fan. The fan blades are curved and form a sort of bowl shape. The bottom of this bowl is the intake side. 

If you've done all that, and with new thermal paste, clean fans, and good airflow it's still overheating - and judging by the age of the CPU, I am assuming this used to be fine, or I'd suggest a bigger cooler - then you can start considering a new 11th gen Intel CPU. A quick check online tells me that they go for about 70-140€ used in my area, dont let them sell you a new part, it'll cost way too much for what it is.",3,False,1jojg3n

VPN providers ( Like your Norton VPN) use a combination of owned and leased servers to move your web traffic. 

Cheaper, or less trust worthy VPNs lease shared servers, which ultimately get used by bad actors to do bad things which ends up putting these shared ips on widely used blacklists for bots / malicious actions.

Now you, a normal user is accessing these IPS and being flagged as rhe same malicious actors. 

Another way it can work is some people, like proton may use a company called data camp limited which is a registered hosting company, and so it's auto flagged regardless of ip blacklisting (think Google leads service).

Honestly, you're fine with just Windows Defender and a good ad blocker. Firefox with uBlock Origin is the best malware defense because it blocks all the shitty ads that try to infect you. Windows Defender catches the rest.

I would first recommend looking up how to do a SMC and a PRAM reset for this model of macbook, that is the most commen fix for ""slow MacBooks.""

 Secondly I would check your storage, if you are using more than ~80% you can sometimes see a depreciation in performance that grows exponentially the less free space you have (this can be more or less apparent depending on the size of your drive) 

Third if you are still having issues you can reinstall mac os through recovery mode (just clicking reinstall will not erase your computer, just reinstall the operating system over itself the same way an update would) 

If all else fails you can get an external solid state drive and make a time machine backup (reference the amount of data you were using earlier to know what size drive to purchase, I typically default to 1tb because they work in 90% of use cases) after you have your time machine backup you can erase your mac and reinstall mac os and see if the issue is resolved (after testing you can open up migration assistant and recover the user profile and all the data by plugging in the drive you made a time machine backup to)

"First things first - shut your computer down and get some sleep. I've learned the hard way that exhaustion and panic are a dangerous combination that lead to all kinds of avoidable mistakes. Your odds of successful recovery will not change while your computer is powered off, but a single preventable mistake is all it takes to ruin them. If the disk is an HDD, the format was a quick format, and you haven't written data to it since it was formatted, your chances of successful recovery are pretty good. And they'll stay that way if (and only if) you come at this with a clear head.

Is your external drive encrypted with bitlocker? If not, are you sure it's not showing up? Linux uses a different naming scheme for storage devices than Windows does - Windows calls mounted drives C:\, D:\, E:\, etc. Linux gives disks names in the format /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc. Linux Mint is compatible with NTFS, so the filesystem shouldn't be the problem.

You could try a clean install of Windows 10 on your C drive instead of 11, in case compatibility issues are to blame. Also, from within Linux Mint, run a SMART self-test on your C drive - see if it has hardware problems that might be corrupting fresh Windows installs.

If you're going to get a SATA to USB adapter, check whether your HDD is a 2.5"" or 3.5"" drive first. 2.5"" HDDs can run on 5V power from USB, and will work with those small and inexpensive SATA to USB cables. 3.5"" HDDs need 12V power, and will require a SATA to USB adapter that has its own external power (adapters with external power will work with both 2.5"" and 3.5"" drives, but the simple adapter cables will only work with 2.5"" drives). 2.5"" HDDs are small, about 2 3/4"" by 4"" - roughly wallet-sized. 3.5"" HDDs are bigger, about 4"" by 5 3/4"" - two of them side-by-side would be the size of a typical paperback book.

Do you have any evidence for that? Benchmarks done over 20+ modern games on multiplecsites clearly suggest a 5070TI beeing 2-3% faster than the 9070XT and the 5080 beeing 17-18% faster.

You keep repeating the same thing, yet you won't actually link anything to back it up. I watched a few comparisons and the 5080 wins in a very strong majority of the games shown in raster.

The batteries used in UPS are designed to stay charged for most of their life. Most UPSs will test the battery every once in a while and will alert you when the battery needs to be replaced.

Batteries degrade over time, and typically, a traditional lead-acid battery will be good for 3-5 years depending on things like temperature and how often it is discharged. There are now consumer grade UPSs that used Li-Ion batteries that will last longer, but they will cost more.

There is no need to unplug your UPS. It's designed to operate 24/7. In fact, leaving a battery hooked up in a UPS that is turned off for long periods of time is worse for the life of the battery.

"The professional cards differ from the consumer cards in a few ways, even though they are functionally the same GPU:

* They have professional tier, signed drivers and are signed off / tested to specifically work with various professional software programs + ECC memory. This matter more in Enterprise or in very important rendering tasks, such as designing a bridge where people's lives depend on the perfect accuracy of the results
* Usually more VRAM than their consumer counterpart.

The RTX 8000 is basically a professional version of the 2080ti + more VRAM, ECC memory, lower clocks, and signed drivers. Unless you *specifically* are limited by VRAM and not by compute, then a 4090 or 5090 is the better choice for you.

The G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB has a height of 44mm. So coolers like the Phantom Spirit and the Peerless Assassin, which have a 42mm clearance, will need to have the outside fan adjust up to make room. The Noctua has a 32mm height limitation before you hit that outside fan so that'll need to have the fan moved up a fair bit and bump the overall height off the cooler to 180mm. Pretty sure the Dark Rock Pro will support the 44mm RAM height but I'm not 100% on it. 

While all this wont be a problem for overall clearance in the case (love the looks of the PA602 by the by) it is something to keep in mind. 2mm likely wont throw off cooling of the Thermalrights, but the Noctua would have a 12mm change in fan position.

Your current M92p is actually not a bad start, but Marvel Rivals likely requires graphics capabilities that the integrated graphics on that machine might struggle with. Here’s an affordable solution you could try.

Add a low profile graphics card. Since you have a small form factor PC, you'll need a low profile graphics card like a GTX 1030 or GTX 1050 Ti (used or refurbished to save money). These cards are affordable, reliable, and usually petty easy to install.

Upgrade RAM if possible. While 8 gigs of RAM is decent, adding a bit more (to 12 or 16) can also help with overall stability and smoothness. Especially for gaming.

Check Drivers and Software...

\- Make sure all your Windows updates and graphics drivers are fully updated.

\-Verify your steam files: (Right click on Marvel Rivals in Steam > Properties > Installed Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files).

Optimize settings. After installing graphics card, set Marvel Rivals to run on the lowest graphics settings to boost performance.

Also, don't hesitate to ask if your school's esports program or local tech clubs might have used components or could help with installation.

"GeForce Now has a 'free' tier that he could use to practice, but you have to wait in line to play. Once he gets to the actual tournament, you'll have to pony up the monthly fee for a bit. Having tried a few streaming services while I was quarantined away from my family (and gaming PC) during COVID, GeForce now is the best of them in terms of performance, and at $10/month is is by far the most affordable way to play PC games.

Also, to put this in perspective for you, the people who are hating on GFN in here have gaming PCs that they spent between $750 and $10k on and think that you can't compete without one. Will you win first place using GeForce now? Probably not. Can you still join in and have fun playing, and still beat players who aren't top-tier in skill? Absolutely.

Now, if at some point you have $350 available, grab an old HP Z420 workstation off ebay with the following specs, should be about $150:
CPU = E2697v2
RAM = at least 32GB
SSD = at least 256 GB

Then find either an AMD Radeon RX6600 or an nVidia RTX 3060 off ebay (should be < $200) and have a tech savvy friend install it for you. You now have the cheapest semi-competent gaming PC that you can build to run a game like that at low settings.

The reality of the situation is that there is an extreme shortage of graphics accelerators right now, so PC gaming is expensive as a result. That RX6600 that I told you to buy off Ebay for $200 was selling NEW for less than that when on sale a year ago. It's a bad time for PC gaming.

EDIT: If you want something that doesn't require some assembly, you can get something like this off aliexpress (the exact CPU you want is a 7735HS, it's just fast enough to play that game and 720P (low resolution), but still moderately affordable): https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806208954672.html ... you want at least 32GB RAM and 256GB SSD.

If you really want an annoying situation of most people using the wrong technical term and it actually sometimes complicating things, think about ""scanlines"" for CRT displays. Nowadays people almost universally use it to mean the black lines you might get on some CRT screens when playing old games and especially for stuff displaying at 240p or thereabouts.

Scanlines are actually the opposite: they are the lines of image scanned in lines across the phosphors by the electron gun, and on various CRT displays you can end up with gaps between the scanlines which most people now call scanlines. This is likely due to early emulators having a ""scanline effect"" and it sounding a bit confusing.

It gets a bit annoying when you might need to explain to someone why their little 14 inch CRT with a low TVL count won't show the scanlines they were expecting, and then you have to introduce them to actual scanlines, tell them the term almost everyone uses is technically wrong... It can be a headache, and you can sound like a try-hard if you insist on referring to ""scanline gaps"" generally even on a CRT forum; it's just so normal to use scanlines to mean the black/blank lines, so you only get pedantic if the situation really calls for it.

K actually does mean something and always has, and it was never “roughly 1000 pixels”. K stands for Kilo, and more specifically a binary Kilo, or 2^10, which is 1024.

3840x2160 is called 4K with UHD added, to differentiate it from 4K DCI.

The ""K""-designation only says that it's close to that pixel count on the horizontal axis, not that it's over said amount of pixels. 4K (DCI) also doesn't have exactly 4000 pixels horizontally.

2560x1440 is over 500 pixels (or .5K) above 2K DCI (2048x1080) so no, it's not correct to call it 2K. IF you want to use the K-naming sceme on it (which technically is wrong (which is the worst kind of wrong /j)) you would call it 2.5K.

"Hey there - HP from CORSAIR here.

We have gotten a few reports of this, and have put in place some changes to the components that makes this noise in the PSU (it only happens with very specific hardware configurations, under very specific load levels as you also experienced)

The good news is that this is not dangerous, or affects performance in any way. The bad news is that it is annoying to listen to. I have an article from our director of power supplies that will go live today that explains the issue and I will edit the link into this comment in a few hours.

In the meantime, if you open an RMA directly with us and send me the ticket number I can have someone take a look and get you a new PSU once we have inventory of the revised units, or we can give you a refund if you purchased through our webstore.

First step is to not freak out. There are several layers of protection at work for you. Stock cooler should be just fine for your CPU however it needs to be installed correctly.

"BEFORE you spend money at a repair shop. If you have the system plugged into a power strip or could check the fuse box... I would first check to see if the fuse got tripped. May have had a power surge. If there was a circuit flip then there is what happened. If not then most likely the PSU croaked.

If that fails then check the motherboard for misplace or loose cables. Also check for blown capacitors -the square things. If they don't ""look"" square then most likely the Motherboard croaked. If you have a spare PSU try it before doing anything else. If you get no response then take it to the shop if your concerned you made a mistake.

2) Your PSU switch isn't set to on.

3) Check if your Motherboard has its 24-pin connector loose (or any power connector loose). You can also check if there's any debugging LED lights when you try turning on the PC from there.

If you have the know-how, try jump starting your pc using the pins on the motherboard instead of the power button on the case.

But most importantly of all! Do not freak out. Do only what you're comfortable with and start simple!

Test outside the pc by checking the outlet you used. Then move onto your PC by checking the power cables from the PSU to your components. Make sure they're not loosely connected.

2: remount your cooler. Remove the cooler, scrape off any old thermal paste, reapply paste, then reinstall cooler. Remember to properly tight it down, it should have pretty tight contact with the CPU. Make sure the cable for the fan cooler is plugged in

3: Check your RAM. Motherboards usually have 4 rams slots, but most people use only 2. Wich 2 slots to use is important. For most motherboards, it is optimal to use slots 2 and 4, counting from the CPU (left to right)

Strong disagree here.

My emperical evidence. I recently ordered a new hard drive...BAD...replacement...BAD...replacement...BAD...I finally ordered a batch of 5 hard drives and the first one worked.

3/4 failures = 75% failure rate.

Statistically unlikely, but non-zero.

Same with my recent 4k monitor purchase. Bought two, both bad (random dropped signal). Both replaced and no issue.

2/4 = 50% failure rate.

So the reason they say this is because back in the day all PSU's had a fuse in them and it was very common for them to blow and you could just swap it out.

Then in the early 2000's they started gluing all the parts down to the board and removed the fuse.  
They did this so instead of fixing it at a repair shop you would just buy a new one.  Mind you, back then they were 20 bucks so my labor to repair was more than it was worth.

I'm not saying people should go opening power supplies without knowing what they are doing. But this is technically quite an exaggeration.

Discharge resistors will usually protect you.

Typically a psu will have caps at the 200 to 500 voltage range.

Ac is different because capacitance and inductance play a factor, the human body has capacitance which is why much lower ac voltage is dangerous. Plus the alternating waveform is more disruptive to the heart rhythm.

"Based on its specs compared to the 5070, the 5060 will be powerful enough to handle (with DLSS Quality) psycho ray tracing, ultra, 4x frame gen Cyberpunk and the equivalent in other titles. The 5060 TI will be even more powerful.

However, with 8GB of VRAM, the 5060 and 5060 TI can't actually run some newer AAA games with settings at that level, and presumably an even higher percentage of upcoming games will be as bad or worse.

I don't blame Nvidia for only giving these GPUs 8GB of VRAM, though. Far too many game devs just don't care enough to optimize their games for VRAM usage at 1080p. They know that the most popular 1080p GPUs have 8GB, but they still require up to 10GB for max settings. 

For comparison, 12GB of VRAM is enough for max settings without path tracing at 1440p in everything, with the possible exception of notable VRAM-offender Indiana Jones (it's right on the edge, and its VRAM requirements vary from patch to patch). It's just 1080p that's being ignored.

For now, I see any GPU with 8GB of VRAM mostly as an esports card. The 5060 will be amazing for games like Fortnite and Marvel Rivals, but terrible for games like Indiana Jones. It'll still be great for AAA titles that are optimized for VRAM, but anyone who buys a 5060 should definitely research how much VRAM new AAA games need before buying them in order to avoid having to run them at low settings.",4,False,1jr7wof

What many people don't understand about these incidents, they are caused by individuals. This isn't WD or some corporation trying to be greedy. As much as they like to be as greedy as possible, doing something like this for greed is counter productive.

In my mind having all the top fans as exhaust, meant the first one was immediately sucking out the fresh air coming from the front intake, and the CPU cooler was kind of sucking in the hot air coming out the GPU.

I figured that having top as intake and front as intake isn’t optimal either because air turbulence. But in my mind:

-possitive pressure with plenty of fresh air for the CPU cooler to suck with the drawback of air turbulences was better than a loop of airflow that isn’t reaching the CPU cooler so it’s kind of sucking whatever is left with mostly hot air.

Maybe we need to start looking at *why only x3d cpus have this problem* as well.  Now that it's confirmed the x950 is also a victim, consider the common feature.

We know the vcache is thermally sensitive, and that it is a insulator.  When am4 and zen4 had the cache on top of the die, it had to be run at reduced clocks with a significantly lower tjmax to avoid thermal issues.  Zen5 put that thermally sensitive insulator below the die this time so it didn't conflict with the cooling solution's ability to conduct heat away.

"I also have few to no problem with Windows 11 itself. But that doesn't take away from Microsofts way of taking decision after decision that is clearly hostile towards their userbase, making the experience and product actually worse for paying customers.

Windows 11 could be so much better for so many people, if they didn't put their corporate interest first, no matter what. The clearly do not actually care if people like it or not, because they know that people don't have a real choice and will use it regardless.

We're on a clear path to a walled-garden, subscription-only OS with features removed that were working perfectly fine in Windows 7, with AI-Search that - again - is worse than the regular one we had in windows 7, and one that can add/remove features against users choice at any time.

I hate it. Not the OS itself, that works okay for me. But the direction and their utter lack of care doesn't. Instead of listening to them, and making them WANT a Microsoft account and internet connection at installation time, because idk... it DOES SOMETHING FOR THEM?!... they are forcing them into it, because that's the only way they will do it. That says everything you need to know about it, really.

I have some questions for Microsoft...

* Why does it keep forgetting my second monitor?
* Why do UI actions lag on a high-end machine?
* Why does Auto-HDR cause crashing 4 months after they've announced that one of their patches broke it?
* Why do you lie to me about needing TPM? It clearly doesn't actually need it, and AMDs implementation of fTPM is trash. I'd rather not have it.
* Why does Onedrive keep syncing desktop shortcuts and invisible dotfiles?
* Why does Edge forget half the passwords it's supposed to save?
* Why can I not buy LTSC as an end-user?
* Why do I have ads even if I buy ""Pro for Workstations""?
* Why can't I anser the privacy questions once and then it remembers my choices from the Microsoft accounts?
* Why does ""Import settings from other machine"" at installation not ACTUALLY DO THAT?
* Why is Game Bar not more functional? Especially since some AMD users now have to use it
* Why does it notify me about random things unless I forbid it? Stop being annoying please!
* Why is there no easy way of carrying windows-keys with my microsoft account and assigning them to machines, maybe on the microsoft website after login?
* Why does it not remember I have a 365 subscription and auto-install office on install when I even tell it that it's a work machine? THAT'S WHAT THE FCKING LOGIN SHOULD BE FOR...
* Why do monitors with different refresh rates still cause micro stuttering in some situations? This has worked in Windows 7 and broke with Windows 8's new driver model. They've never fixed it.
* Why is there no easy way to free space on the C-drive after installing a second drive? Look what Steam does - implement exactly like it. Done. Or even better, a ""extend c-drive"" option and make it automatic.
* Why is the zip/unzip and file-copy still brutally slow compared to third-party apps?
* Why do I have to have that new taskbar? The old one was better. I don't have PROBLEMS with the new one... but man, the old one was better. Why take it from me?",3,True,1jr0az0

"Some (many?) American cities have internet monopolies. In my particular city, only one company can provide broadband internet.  In my part of the city, before 2023, I had two choices:

1. Broadband (Cox), which had an OK download rate but a terrible upload rate and ever-increasing fees.  Their services also went down ocassionally, usually at around midnight.  I sometimes had to log in to work between 1 am and 3 am, so these service disruptions could produce anxiety.
2. DSL (AT & T). They provide UP to 50 mbps. Yep, that's 50 mbps.  Also, AT & T is terrible when it comes to customer service.

So, I had a choice between a service that provided a good download rate but a bad upload rate (Cox) and another service that was just bad all around (AT & T).  AT & T provides faster rates elsewhere (even fiber), but not in my block.

With these two limited options, Cox raised fees, removed unlimited data (it's an extra fee now), and placed stricter limits on the upload rate.  Since there was no real competition, there was no incentive to provide better service or to lower prices.

A new company came in some years ago and started providing fiber service.  Fortunately for me, they started in my part of the city, so I was a beta customer.  They have spread out over the years, providing actual competition to the dreaded Cox Communications.

Am4 is easier than am5. It's the LGA socket that most often is the issue. I fucked my own board last weekend in a freak accident as I was trying to borrow the cpu for a different build temporarily. A gob of  paste fell off and onto the socket.  Brilliant me thought I will use compressed air to blow it off. Straw flew off can and into socket. Board actually did post but audio was gone as it broke pins off. Now my wallet is $240 lighter as I scrapped the x670e (2 years old) and replaced it with a b850. Live and learn. I've messed with am4 boards many times but never had an issue. The lga socket is a different animal and a high risk thing to deal with imho. Avoid messing with the socket unless you absolutely have to. And be crazy careful. I already knew the last part and still fucked it up.,11,False,1jgacyc

There was 3 MSI pro B650-s boards (one of them is not boxed in the top left, and other one in the B550 Prime box lol, and one in a regular box) and a couple of ASUS boards.

What I am thinking is that these were mainly from Microcenter returns doing their bundle deals and customers returning those boards. Probably first timers buying a honestly good deal for some PC parts but accidentally dropping the sharp corner from the CPU or coolers on the pins and getting a return on that specific motherboard.

And this ebay seller probably buying a pallet of broken motherboards from Microcenter.

Even had some of the boxes had the Microcenter stickers on them as ""Open-Box"" or ""RTV, Damaged""

we had our big group of friends constantly hanging out on vent bullshitting and doing random stuff either together or alone, but getting to talk about life at the same time! 

teamwork skills got dialed in and that actually helps in work settings to this day, like the corp shit i gotta deal with is nothing compared to a guild run when the BIS drops and everyone starts freaking out or something lmao

obv i couldnt live like that now with adult responsibilities, i dont have the time, but i would not trade my WoW days for anything, it was truly some of the best years of my life! id give a lot to go back to wotlk launch for a month with the peak friend group and just enjoy the simplicity of life and endless adventure of the unknown. knew enough about the game from a couple years of playing but still so new and magical and just ughhh, that feeling is irreplaceable for me",4,False,1f69tlp

"Yeah, I definitely understand that. I thought the graphics would turn me off when I first heard of Factorio.

Got Satisfactory when it came to Steam, and it's definitely fun, but anytime I play a different factory sim, it ALWAYS makes me wanna return to Factorio and the real reason is SCALE.

Factorio you can get to a point where you're making tens of thousands of items per minute, your automation is simultaneously killing hordes of enemies, repairing the spots they get through, routing dozens of trains through your sprawl. It turns alive at a scale that staggers me, and I can scarcely believe that IM the one that actually set it up. The bigger 3D games will always hit a wall sooner than Factorio partially because the 3D takes up so much more resources, and partially because Wube (the developer) is an absolute master class in refining the efficiency of their code base. 

Add on to this that the modding community has added quality content that literally increases the playable content tenfold. A game that took me 50 hours to achieve the objective (launch a rocket) has mods that incredibly increase the scale to about 300 hours (Space Exploration) and even 2000 hours (looking at you Pyanadons).

"I keep seeing people saying that air coolers are still the way to go over AIOs on modern chips, and following that info I bought an NH-D15s for a 13700k on my most recent rebuild.

Most multicore loads would either float around 80-95c or would throttle. Gaming would also be In the 75-80c range (and sometimes higher). Undervolting and turning off any OC features dropped it down to the 75-80c range in MC workloads, but I don’t want to limit the expensive ass CPU I bought just to justify a tower cooler I already bought. So I got and installed the Liquid freezer 3. My temps now max out at around 80c in MC loads with it pretty heavily overclocked, and has the benefit of being more quiet. Newer intel chips just run fucking hot when you put them through their paces, and in my case it isn’t even a top of the line chip.

Your 7950X is likely being tamed reasonably well by an NHD15, though I'd be interested in seeing your temperatures or BIOS settings on a full load, since the 7950X by default should be pumping up the power until it hits around 95C unless you have an extremely powerful cooling solution to keep the temperatures tamed once it hits max TDP and max vcore.

It definitely looks like the cables got too hot from amperage being carried.   This caused the sheath to melt exposing the actual wire.

Those plastic brackets could have been melted without a full blown fire.  There likely was some flame, but it also was likely choked by a lack of oxygen because the air flow died with tte fans when everything overloaded.  That leads to the idea this “wasn’t a fire”.  This damage wasn’t caused by fire.  The same thing that caused the damage caused some burning insulation, but the damage was done by the wires overloading. if a fire was doing the damage, other combustible component would also be damaged.",8,False,1d69i3x

If the fan was connected to a header on the motherboard it would have stall protection that would prevent this, but if it was a shitty molex fan then combined with the shitty power supply that has no protections, they might have had the incredible failure mode of causing a massive load and melting the cables.

In that case, it is still the PSU, because the PSU should have over current protections. Before it outputs enough power to melt cables, a fuse should've melted or a breaker should've flipped. The fact that it kept delivering power until all the cabling had melted tells me the power supply had no fault protection and therefore complied with 0 safety standards.",6,False,1d69i3x

Of course you can fake those but as I said, if there is a certification ID and it checks out with the product it is probably legit.

I have a NAS with 14 drives in it that's based off a second gen i5, has two sticks of ram and two extra sata controller cards in it. It draws 120-150W most of the time for the whole system and only *very* briefly spikes juuuuust over 200W total, measured at the wall, so including inefficiencies in the power supply. When booting it'll be around 250-300W. Granted, this is running headless without a graphics chip of any sort, neither integrated nor dedicated, but it goes to show how little power most drives use. 

Transient spikes are noticeable and not something to be ignored and since multiple components can have power spikes, especially during initial boot or while loading it should be kept in mind when choosing a power supply.

“In the past twenty years, access to the internet has only become more widespread and service today is far faster for many people — including “ordinary” people — than it was twenty years ago, or even ten years ago. Today, broadband in Europe, where the internet is more tightly regulated, has less reach than it has in the United States.”

“In truth, net neutrality has never fostered fairness or better access for consumers, and has instead created conditions that will encourage less competition and more monopolistic power for large firms within the industry. 

Instead of relying on the market place to allocate goods, net neutrality ensures that politics will determine who gets what, instead. This is hardly a recipe for fairness or neutrality.”

Since its inception, the Internet has been used to transform telecommunications and has led to groundbreaking developments and innovations. Keeping the internet free of government control has allowed it to thrive and prosper in unimaginable ways. Unfortunately, as you may know, in 2015 the FCC reclassified the internet as a public utility which subjected it to further government regulation. Recently however, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has indicated support for repealing some of those regulations.

Rest assured I fully support keeping the internet free of regulation, taxation, and needless federal intrusion. It is paramount that we keep the Internet independent so that we don’t stifle progress and hurt future ingenuity. Know that I share many of your concerns and continue to be a strong supporter of a free and open internet. While I am not a member of the committees with direct jurisdiction over issues surrounding the Internet, please know that I will keep your thoughts in mind.”

Then restart the PC

Microsoft Windows Defender will now take control and keep your PC secured.

Now the major cause of viruses and Malware on computers is websites and web browser downloads.

Will a little change in behaviour and some precaution taken - your PC will be secure.

Firstly - if you download anything dodgy and you ahve doubts baout it, upload it to www.virustotal.com

This will scan the upload with over 70 different major Antiviruses and report the results.

https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload

Upload a file to test, so you can see how effective it is.

Here's a YouTube video on the process https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b67h3U4OeAI

Next - you can install an AD-Blocker that will protect your web browser from accessing dodgy or suspect websites.

If you use Firefox, try Ublock Origin https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

Chrome no longer supports uBo as it interferes with Gogoles revenue oincome. Instad, you can use the slightly less effective  https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en-GB&pli=1

uBo Lite gets around the Google Chrome blocks, but is only 90% as effective.

Third option is more technical - it's a DNS block that stops all apps and web browsers from accessing dodgy and malware websites. It's strictly optional as using uBo duplicates a lot of the feature.

https://controld.com/free-dns

https://nextdns.io/

https://quad9.net/ - this one is good.

"Hello,

Former Microsoft Most Valuable Professional ([MVP](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112041455/https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/10023)) awardee here (2004-2018).  I was not particularly active on Microsoft's newsgroups, or its web forum, but did support in places like Chris Pirillo's Lockergnome Help Forum, Lenovo Help Forum, Neowin, Scot Finnie's Newsletter, Neowin, and other places which either no longer exist these days, or have been greatly diminished by the rise of places such as Reddit and Stack Overflow.

The MVP program was originally owned by the Product Support Group (PSG) at Microsoft and started on CompuServe, to give you an idea of how old the program is.  It was a way to recognize people who were volunteering their time helping Microsoft's customers solve problems with Microsoft's software that sometimes even Microsoft couldn't.  Basically, it was an award you received from Microsoft for your previous 12 month's of those activities, and it was renewed (or not) on an annual basis.

Anyways, the MVP Award was a way to recognize those folks for helping, and they got access to internal resources at Microsoft, ranging from regular meetings with product groups to discuss product strategy, very early versions of products to provide feedback on, and so forth.  That's pretty useful stuff, and suggestions MVPs passed along made it into a lot of final products, which was good for both Microsoft and the MVPs.  

The MVP Program has had many owners within the company over the years, including periods where there wasn't really one--the program was just operating on life support.  The last I heard, it was owned by the marketing department.  

Although Microsoft doesn't share the criteria for receiving an MVP Award, I did note how the data they asked for when renewals came up over the years (MVPs are awarded annually).  It was a lot less focused on the complexity of the problems I was solving, or the number of folks helped by it, than it was by KPIs like the audience size of your blog, the amount of members your web forum had, and number of posts you made.  I get it; it's hard to manage several thousands of volunteers and try to quantify their individual contributions versus looking at numbers on a spreadsheet.

It has been six years since I've been an awardee, and I would expect that the program has changed a bit in that time, so I don't know what the interactions are like with Microsoft these days.

I'm still proud of the help I provided back then, and continue to try and help people out these days as well, just like I did before I received the award.  There are lots of current former MVPs who do the same, too.  You just have to look for them.

At least windows has task scheduler as a pretty gui to do the same thing.

"When someone says they want a UI that can ""match the fluidity and quality of macOS,"" they are not saying they want a UI that looks like a cheap ripoff of macOS. They're saying they want a UI that is *as good as* macOS, regardless of exactly how it looks. Elementary OS is garbage, it's just GNOME with a shitty skin that looks OS X Leopard, which came out 15 years ago. It doesn't solve any of the underlying problems of the DE in terms of quality, fluidity, polish, etc. 

It's the same with Windows. 20 years ago people would recommend Lindows, which just looked like a cheap ripoff of Windows XP. 15 years ago people would praise the Windows 7 UI and Linux nerds would respond with Compix and Beryl, plugins that added transparent glass effects to the UI. But they did nothing to actually improve the UI, they just tacked on bad glass effects to a UI that was already bad. And today Linux nerds will recommend things like Linux Mint to Windows users, thinking it will be easy to learn because it's a roughly similar UI, when it just looks shitty and outdated.

And therein lies the problem with pushing Linux. End users like things that look nice, clean, polished, modern, etc. Linux users like things that look like computers from the 90s.

Why isn't the left side of the launcher aligned with the left side of the panel? Why are there so many icons in the right side of the panel? Why is the spacing between everything so inconsistent? Look at the user's ""CS"" icon in the top left of the launcher. Why is the spacing different on all four sides? Why are Linux app launchers always bloated with 14 unnecessary categories? Why are Linux's fonts and font rendering so bad? This has been a known issue since I first tried Linux 20 years ago and the fonts still look horrible compared to Windows.

What you have to understand it is that Proton, which is the compatibility layer developed by Valve and based off of wine Is usually foiled by kernel level anti-cheat if the developers haven't bothered to flip the switch to support it.

"Completely overblown.

The premise is that once a Windows version stops being patched, new patches for the newer supported versions will be reverse engineered to find the exploits it patches, and those exploits can be used on older windows versions.

This tends to be true, but it's rather overstated. For home users almost nobody is directly infected merely through exploits. There's inevitably some level of social engineering involved; from ""Visit this particular website"" to straight-up running some executable that they shouldn't.

I have Windows machines running Windows 2000, XP, 7 and 8.1 connected to my network, for example. They all have their firewalls and Windows defender (if applicable) completely disabled. I've had no issues.

The main issues as others have said would be software dropping support for Windows 10. There's two kinds of that ""dropping support"".

1. Software integrates features from a newer OS and doesn't implement fallbacks, so the program would crash on older releases

2. They ""drop support"" and just prevent installation/running on the now unsupported version even though they do not actually utilize any new features.
The former case, you are usually out of luck; sometimes something like Win32s, KernelEx, One Core, etc shows up and does provide wider functionality and APIs that software uses, but that's not a guarantee and installing those is not really a picnic either.

In the latter case sometimes you can workaround things- sometimes the installer is doing the check for example but manually unpacking and installing the program works. You can run Firefox 116 this way (Edit: on Windows 7) even though 115 was the last supported version (they ""fixed"" it in 117 however by adding the check to the program itself). Stuff will, eventually, make use of platform APIs not available though.

"Well if Microsoft keeps giving defender updates since W10 going on extended support for 3 years. That may help for some time but the moment both system security updates stop and defender updates also stop you will have a system that wont be secure. Unless you can use different av and firewall that still gets latest updates.  Using updated web browser with Ublock origin and no script addon will also help.  But eventually web browsers will stop supporting EOL OS.  Firefox has the extended support for W7 until Sept 2024 even though W7 went EOL 2020 and its extended support ended 2023.  So its likely Firefox will support W10 for next 3 or 4 years as well.  So assuming you have updated browser, updated av and firewall, then be careful with stuff you download.  You may be ok for using W10 for next 3 years.  After that it will be more iffy. 

Modern routers and modems also have built in antivirus. I have Asus router that is over 10 years old. It has built in Trend Micro. My modem also has built in antivirus.  So i would suggest having those for protection as well.

- AnyDesk (backup option for TeamViewer)

- Steam Remote Play (although it's not used for remote access to desktop I used it some times to play games.

"First and most importantly use a personal private network. To do this, install Tailscale or ZeroTier on each of your devices to have a secure virtual network between the machine you want to access and the machines you access from.

After installed and logging in to tailscale or zerotier on each of your devices, each of the devices will have an ip address in that virtual network. We will use those addresses to define which machine we will connect to. 

Afrer having a virtual network between your machine, the next step is setting up remote access software. I suggest the combination of Sunshine and Moonlight. 

Sunshine is a software which accepts connections to control the device running it. 

Moonlight is the software which is connecting to the sunshine machines. 

Install sunshine on the machine you want to access to, and Moonlight on the machines you want to access from. 

After installing and running Sunshine, it will run a server on the background to accept connections.  

On the client machines, run moonlight and pair with the sunshine server. To do so, in the main screen of Moonlight manually add the server IP of the machine running Sunshine. Use the Tailscale or Zerotier IP or FQDN of the machine you want to access. 

You may be requested to enter a pin code to finish up the pairing. 

When done you achieved:

1. Setting up secure private network between your personal devices which you can use for any task. 
2. Remote access your device over the internet from any machine logged into that private network. 
3. Best low-latency gaming/streaming level capable remote access including sound and video.

"> Switch 1 was like that too, but they'd probably need to use more capable flash storage for switch 2 cards' speed. 

Switch 1 cards did have a security controller of some kind on them, though it was embedded into the single chip package. So it was not direct-wired NAND. Otherwise, making conterfeit carts would be rather easy, I reckon.

https://web.archive.org/web/20170525153413/https://www.texplained-store.com/en/Blog/8_how-it-is-made-zelda-botw-cartridge.html

Not a ton about the on-cart security processor is publicly documented (it's not really necessary *unless* you want to make a counterfeit cart), but it is known that it uses a wide, SPI-like data bus. With the security processor acting as the intermediary.

https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Gamecard#Protocol

Nintendo did eventually have to deal with piracy carts relatively late in the life of the Switch 1 - the Mig Switch and its clones - so it's a safe bet that there will be further security upgrades this time around. But we'll have to see just how far out they go.

For reference, the Switch 1 used a custom controller on the console side, too (Lotus3). If Nintendo did the same thing here while mixing that with SD Express technology (i.e. PCIe/NVMe), then it would mean needing to make what's essentially a PCIe bridge chip (PCIe in and out). That would be rather expensive. 

It's possible they could just take their 8-bit SPI bus and clock it higher, but I'm not sure how much further that would scale. SD had to go with LVDS starting in UHS-II, which is why the additional pins were needed. Even without PCIe, LVDS drives up the complexity (and thus cost) significantly, for both the console and the cartridge.

There will be the errant phone - or more commonly, Android tablet - that uses the tech. Consumer cameras still often use microSD as well. And, unexpected enough, it's used as local storage for security cameras as well.

It's *possible* that microSD Express could end up eating the CFexpress market based on volume alone - just the Switch 2 all but guarantees that microSD Express card production will vastly exceed CFexpress. In which case prosumer hardware will eventually come into the fold.

I won't even try to predict when devices that aren't game consoles and high-performance cameras switch over to Express speeds, either. We'll probably see devices stick with UHS-I microSD for many years to come, similar to how USB 2.0 ports have never fully died out.

>One of the core Android principles is that you never need a file manager. Ever. We wanted to avoid the obnoxious ""sneeze and a file picker appears"" syndrome of basically every other OS. Local data that apps know how to handle should just be magically available within the apps, or stored in the cloud. You shouldn't have to go spelunking on your SD card to find data.

>The problem with having both internal storage and SD cards is that suddenly that goal gets a whole lot harder to achieve. For a given shot, should the camera save to internal-16GB, or to SD card? Should an app from Market be installed to internal or SD? etc.

>Yes, we can solve this by letting the user choose, or have it be in settings. But then, that's a file picker, or close enough to the file picker experience that we dislike it just as much.

>And besides that, there are API consequences: if you stick in an SD card with photos on it, do you add those to the system media content provider? If you do, you will screw up apps because they aren't designed with the concept that photos can come and go.

>What we will probably do eventually is add an import/export concept to removable storage. So the Camera will always save to internal-16GB, and when you pop in an SD card (or insert a thumb drive on USB host devices) you can start a migration or import/export dialog.

The texture is going to appear sharper on the smaller plane, so I don't really understand how ""4k texture"" has any meaning since the ""real"" resolution depends on the size of individual pixels in the 3D world which depends on the texture resolution and model size.

"It's just adoption issue. In the long run there will be more PCs with TB/USB4 ports. For example, USB4 is required on X870E motherboards.

But why adoption is slow? I think it's because most PC users don't need it. What you mentioned, music production and disk array, are for pro users.

If you think about the use cases of TB/USB4 on laptops:

* as charging port: PC has dedicated PSU
* as video output: PC has dedicated video ports, esp. w/ discrete GPU
* connect to eGPU: you can add discrete GPU to PC directly
* connect to dock for more I/O: PC already has plenty of I/O ports
* connect to 10GbE network adapter: you can get USB or PCIe 10GbE for cheaper
* connect to TB audio interface: niche, most people can live by USB audio interface
* connect to disk array: niche, NAS is probably better

So there's no particular advantage of using TB on PC.

As for Apple, I think their products come with TB for various reasons:

1. they developed TB with Intel so they have vested interest in promoting it and they have the engineering to make it right
2. they strive for minimalist design and the small footprint and flexibility of TB3+ are a good fit

"Combination of factors. Most things Thunderbolt is used for can be accomplished with (and potentially better by) a different preexisting interface (USB, HDMI/DisplayPort, PCIe slots).

Funny enough, the Mac Mini's form factor helps quite a bit because it's too small to need (multiple?) retimers. 

Also, one of the flagship use cases is displays, and that means that if you have a desktop with a dGPU (i.e. most use cases that you'd specifically want a desktop for), you need a way to route that GPU's output back to the Thunderbolt controller (either discrete or integrated). None of this is unsolvable, but it's additional friction that's prevented anyone from making it a priority. And also stuff that doesn't apply to Macs (no PCIe, no dGPUs, etc).

AMD laptops now have access to USB4, which is compatible with (and essentially is) Thunderbolt 4.

"There are some technical reasons, yes.

* Thunderbolt's signaling requirements ironically mean that smaller PCs are sometimes easier to integrate them into, because you can use shorter signal traces and suffer less degradation.
* Most desktop processors do not include a built-in Thunderbolt controller, so adding Thunderbolt on a desktop requires adding a separate controller chip. Some laptop processors and the Apple M-series SoCs have built-in controllers. Apple is able to add so many Thunderbolt ports because they control their own SoC design and specifically design the Thunderbolt controller on their SoC to support that many, so it's relatively cheap and easy to stick a bunch of ports in. Desktop processors do not do the same thing.
* A Thunderbolt controller also consumes PCIe lanes, which is undesirable when lanes are already at a premium on desktops. For mobile, it's typically not a concern even if you're using a separate controller, because PCIe lanes are often not being used for discrete GPUs. (When they are, the same inverse correlation of ""bigger, more powerful discrete GPU -> less likely to have Thunderbolt ports"" exists.)

None of these technical reasons are insurmountable, of course, and there *are* motherboards that have Thunderbolt or at least support a Thunderbolt add-in card. But it all just comes down to the fact that there really isn't a whole lot of demand for Thunderbolt on the desktop side, because many of the peripherals that you'd want to attach via Thunderbolt can usually be attached with other interfaces (monitors -> DisplayPort, audio -> USB, etc) or outright integrated into the PC itself (such as PCIe 10G networking, more hard drives, etc).

it's *slightly* better for usb3+, but almost never enough to justify the additional costs of adding it to the product because there isn't a wide selection of appropriately commodity type usb3+ chips suitable for the application.

pcie is ideal for this, but has fallen by the wayside for a number of reasons, not the least of which is it requires custom windows drivers.

tb3/4 is slightly worse for overhead, is in the same boat as pcie regarding custom silicon or an fpga, plus it either requires a custom driver or has to deal with windows' shitty thunderbolt audio driver.

avb is a great technology and has a lot of opportunities to fix everything, especially at > 1gbe, but windows drivers don't exist and their network and audio stacks are built such that it would be very, very difficult to make a driver.
   
   - the windows avb interface card/driver  that was actually good uses intervalzeeo, a custom windows hal and rtos extension that lets you reserve cores for rtos use. the avb driver in question reserved a core or two and a network port for the rtos, implemented avb (and ptpv2) in the rtos, then a virtual soundcard... the windows side had a driver that talked to the intervalzero rtos implementation.

---

fwiw, i really wish there was an open source intervalzero rtos equivalent, or that windows shipped with something like it even if barebones.

i tried writing one myself, but i got hung up on obtaining a microsoft hal development kit. you need to be a serious company with serious cash to even get MS to talk to you about getting one.

i looked into reverse engineering and sort of hacking my own together, but the sheer amount of estimated effort involved to even get something the equivalent of ”reserve cores, run hello world, output to a common buffer (shared memory) so windows software can use results” was massive.

- reservation of the core and using low level stuff to make something run on a core windows wouldn't use wasn't too bad. 
   - it has a lot in common with toy o/s dev


but getting things integrated into windows such that i didn't need to run everything in privileged accounts (root) as well as disable just about every security feature and malware checker required the hal devkit/sdk, or whatever they call it now. it was difficult to even find it referenced 8 years ago when i was screwing with this.

why?

IDK how much that is to do with better CPU cores leading to better real time performance versus Windows becoming less terrible. But my experience in this area is mostly on the hardware development side of audio interfaces and I've always used the standard UAC 2.0 drivers.

Having clock accurate outputs going to multiple devices is a ridiculously difficult, borderline impossible task. Typically audio interfaces implement their own master clock (MCLK) for converters and USB is operating in async mode, with the host device essentially being the 'slave'. Having multiple devices means they each have their own crystals, which are usually within about 50PPM (unless you use an external clock for multiple devices). 

Unless they share the exact same clock, the async requests from each device are going to slip slightly in regards to one another over time. For example, if we have 2 external devices, and they are both sending their input to each others output, it is entirely likely that the output buffers for each respective device will both underflow and overflow leading to bit slip. 

I must admit I have no idea how the underlying drivers handles these issues, but it wouldn't be surprising to me if it's the same as in hardware? - In hardware, it's not uncommon to implement asynchronous clock conversion in FPGAs, but it does involve a lot of DSP magic, additional buffering and slightly more latency (and it \*technically\* distorts the source signal). Probably the most common example is S/PDIF input ports - there are many ICs that implement clock recovery/DSP magic to do the async conversion for you without having a literal PhD.",5,False,1jnmu5n

> Theres just no way to switch that onto a laptop without Thunderbolt

I wasn’t saying to remove the use of thunderbolt from the laptop, you can still use a Thunderbolt dock then plug the monitors and KVM into that and still get the benefit of both. 

I think I misinterpreted your comment as though you were using thunderbolt for both the Desktop and the Laptop when in actual fact you were just using it for the laptop, my bad.

Regardless, [this setup](https://imgur.com/a/auQq3Cp) has worked fine for me for many years and has practically had no issues. Anything USB and needed on both systems (like my Audio Interface for my microphone or other stuff) goes into the KVM. My dock and PC are both directly plugged into the monitors. 

When I go back and forth, I press one button and I’m done. 

You don’t need to route your display cables through the KVM and can avoid the display issue you’re talking about here. Just use it for USB devices that you want to switch and go directly into the monitor from the dock/PC.",4,False,1jnmu5n

If you want to avoid having to sign off Windows, there's another method. I put a smart plug on my TV's power cable. Then I set a command to power off and on the smart plug.

Retailers are going to mark up cards when there is an extremely limited supply because they are in the business to make money.  Furthermore I clearly pointed out that the blame is 100% on AMD for not supplying enough cards.  It seem to me your claims of bias are completely baseless, but I'm willing to listen if you have any actual rational arguments to make.

That said, the only reason the 9070xts instantly sold out is because NVIDIA basically didn't do their part.  If AMD sent 1000 GPUs to Microcenter then NVIDIA should have sent 5000 at least.  The actual reality is that NVIDIA sent something like 100 cards despite their 85% market share.  Personally I think any criticism aimed at NVIDIA here is very, very justified.  Not only did they fuck up on the supply, but they also made absurd claims regarding multiple frame generation and in an even more customer unfriendly move they only put 12GB VRAM on the 5070.

I'd still buy a 5070ti @ $749 over the 9070xt I got for $599, however, since imo it is a better card.  At least the 9070xt is a serious contender this generation, but NVIDIA should be taking the lion's share of the blame for the lack of supply the GPU market is currently going through because they dominate the market.

Just as Intel fucked up on this generation of CPUs and AMD wasn't able to meet demand since they didn't anticipate Intel fucking up so badly, you can say exactly the same thing about the 9070 vs. the 50xx series from NVIDIA.

"I thought the facilities staff was pretty great and I would never mind working alongside them in case you are trying to be insulting by belittling people working hard for a living.

I was a service engineer. I traveled all over the world. When onsite technicians and engineers couldn't figure out what was wrong with their process or machine, they called the manufacturer. The manufacturer sent me. When I walked out of the fab, the machines were working perfectly every time. That was my job. I installed, troubleshot, and repaired equipment in Bosch, Motorola, AMD, Analog Devices, Cypress Semiconductor, and several other places across the world that I don't recall the names of.

I got very tired of travel. I got tired of long days in a bunny suit doing work for morons who screwed up the machines and insisted they didn't because they didn't want to get in trouble for what it cost to bring me out to fix it.

So I moved into industrial automation controls where I have been working for quite a long time. I write code for supervisory computers that monitor and manage PLCs that automate equipment. I also sling code for various PLC systems and help the electricians find problems when they can't figure out schematics. 

What is your experience in hardware? Do you know more about actually producing semiconductors than an AMD janitor? Have you ever been inside a fab? Do you think knowing the name of the spinoff AMD did to dump their fabs makes you more knowledgeable on this subject versus someone who spend five years inside these facilities getting shit done?

I didn't really keep up with AMD after I left the industry. It didn't really matter to me anymore. I had some friends at Motorola so I do actually know that spun off into Freescale but they all eventually lost their jobs and had to find something else to do because all of it moved to Tawain and China. 

People around here are so very proud of themselves for knowing the names of the dead spinoffs and astonishingly dismissive of someone who has spent twenty hours consecutively pumping wafers through the equipment and scanning it on a KLA to identify the source of particulate contamination in the chemical stream.

I'm starting to suspect this isn't a place to comment because it's not worth the time. There's a difference between someone who actually knows how to and uses these instruments for a living versus a smartass with a keyboard and a bookmark to YouTube and Wikipedia.

"Thanks! It was interesting work. The most challenging problems were the wafers being out of spec after the process finishes. You can't see the problem. You couldn't even see it with a very expensive microscope. It was what I called mental troubleshooting. You had to keep the schematics in your head and really understand the process so you could attack the right subsystems with inspections.

One time I had a nightmare problem I couldn't solve. The process finished with an HF bath. The bare silicon wafer was etched and rinsed with Hydrofluoric Acid.  The KLA kept failing it for too many particles but the machine was spotless. I replaced every teflon valve in the acid stream and even the flow controller which cost a ton of money. After I shipped samples out for SEM, they came back spotless. The problem was that the HF residue on the wafer would cause it to regrow silicon crystals where the droplets skittered across the wafer. So they weren't ""dirty"". They had new silicon growth and the KLA thought it was particles. 

The solution was to change the process because there was nothing wrong with the machine.

We also sold a machine that etched with gaseous HF and the in house techs never wanted to touch it. They were scared of it. I don't blame them. One time the techs at AMD Fab 15 screwed up the leak detectors in it and it leaked gas into the fab's laminar flow air handling system. They called me over to look at it and there was an ambulance taking someone away. The fab had been breached to outside air. I turned around and left. No way I was going in there. They weren't allowed to do the PMs on the machine anymore and had to pay us to do it. Their tech couldn't get the readings to be correct and bypassed the leak detector so it wouldn't bother him.  (He couldn't get it ""right"" because he had connected the bottle wrong and it was leaking!) Evacuated the whole fab. There were people in bunny suits standing around in the parking lot.

i highly suspect these issues comes from the bios implementation with the new agesa ... expo is responsible mem vdd mem vddq and cpu vddio ... vsoc and proc signal resistance is set by the bios ... as expo is turned on usually motherboard bios will drop the memory trace resistance for the signal between the memory controller and rams gets sent thru easier along with raising soc voltage to get the memory controller to be able to work at higher speeds of uclock ... now if the memory controller fails to train the memory possibly it would try give it more voltage to get it to work but supposedly the bios coding is wonky more voltage above 1.3 could be sent to the chip hence causing all these deaths. (its a hypothesis) ... the other theory could be vrm ... i doubt asrock uses cheap quality vrm that feeds the power to the memory controller so maybe some kind of design flaw with the power delivery? just another hypothesis ... as far as i know any x3d chips are more sensitive to voltages and cant be clocked higher or take more voltages compared to the non x3d counterparts because of its design ... anyway these issues have also been seen on msi before they pulled the bios from downloads a few weeks back and also asus with the 7800x3d couple years ago so its not something new ... if you remember up to 5 years ago gigabyte had a similiar issue where they feed more soc voltage that degraded some chips ... if anything if anyone should turn on expo for 6000mt before saving and exit bios just set 1.2 vsoc manually and if youre using higher capacity rams like 2x32gb you may need a little more vsoc,5,False,1jmqajy

AMD can easily exceed Blackwell's RT perf nextgen if they catch up to Blackwell's feature set and finally add BVH traversal in hardware. All the unique changes made with RDNA 4 (read the announcement slides) do add up. 

Also not expecting NVIDIA to just let AMD win and RTX 60 series won't just be Ampere+++, it'll prob be a complete redesign similar to Turing/Volta.

As a side node the overall the Ray tracing behaviour of 50 series is veru odd but not really surprising. RT is MIMD and very cache and memory latency sensitive, raster and compute is SIMD and a lot more memory bandwidth sensitive and less sensitive to, which is likely why some games showed outsized raster gains on 50 series (see DF's 5090 and 5080 CB2077 RT on vs off results).  
If underlying data management architecture and caches haven't improved significantly then that'll bottleneck RT performance.

fwiw people said that they needed a massive amount of catching up if they were even gonna bother including RT in the PS5 and XSX/XSS.

Read Bolt Graphics' patent application (explains how their PT ASIC IP works) and the Whitepaper by Imagination Technologies (level 4 RT IP). Both show how much further NVIDIA can push their RT with 70 series even if they implement only some of the technologies.

I'm glad AMD finally -- or, Sony cut a big enough check for PS6 R&D -- got its shit together so we now have all three major vendors with real deal and performant RT cores so we can finally start leaving raster to the past. 

It's one of the good things looking back that AMD has had such shit marketshare for the past few gens because it makes leaving behind RDNA 1-3 in the future a lot easier on devs, and I say that as someone playing. Games on RDNA 3 HW right now lol.... Thankfully for those people who bought those cards they'll be okay as long as the PS5 is relevant.

"All AMD needs to do is to catch up to Blackwell + keep iterating on the architecture. Implement BVH traversal in HW, thread coherency sorting (SER), opacity micromaps (OMM), LSS and keep iterating on their unique changes introduced in RDNA 4 and.

The difference is that the PS5 and XSX are made for bare bones RT and getting a full PT with specular and indirect lighting and perhaps even limited use of advanced lighting effects like volumetrics, caustics and refractions is a completely different beast. For that to happen AMD will need to make considerably area investments for RT hardware with UDNA and exceed NVIDIA's current designs (significantly lower % drop).

We'll see but don't expect NVIDIA to just allow AMD to catch up next gen. A major RT redesign on the NVIDIA side is extremely likely, so if AMD is serious about software and feature parity then they have to exceed Blackwell's RT hardware significantly.

Here's a list of things NVIDIA could be implementing with 60 series and later architectures:

* OoO ~~execution~~ *memory requests* (RDNA 4)
* *Dynamic allocation for local (SM) data stores (SRAM).* *RDNA 4 has this for VGPRs and M3 have this for all local shader core data stores) = threads don't need to allocate for worst case scenario and can change the memory (SRAM) allocation dynamically freeing up bandwidth and kBs for other threads.*
* *Flexible on chip memory (SM level SRAM stores) that can be configured as anything instead of being fixed allowing for data stores to be tailored to each workload increasing SM efficiency and speed. NVIDIA has had this for L1 cache since Volta/Turing IIRC, but it would be nice to extend this to VRF and other data stores. For example Apple M3's design (*[*Family 9 GPU shader core*](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/111375/)*) is universal and any kB of SRAM can be either a register file, threadgroup and tile memory, or buffer and stack cache.*
* *Cache locality of repurposed cache memory in general. Here's the recent* [*NVIDIA patent*](https://patents.justia.com/patent/12235765)*. Helps with latencies.*
* general low level changes to ISA and SM to make it much more bandwidth and cache efficient in general (pretty much unchanged since Volta)
* different kinds of coherency sorting to minimize divergence and get SIMD execution at the ray level instead of on the thread level (SER).
* fixed function hardware accelerators in shaders for all the calculations related to RT when the RT core has returned a hit
* OBBs (RDNA 4)
* New formats beyond OBBs and LSS
* Ray instance transform in HW (similar to RDNA 4)
* various small changes to RT that add up.
* Dedicated BVH cache within RT cores to minimize latency compared to LDS requests",13,True,1jcoklb

"Yes as long as 9th gen Consoles keep being supported devs will continue to implement anemic RT low on PC because they have too (maximize TAM to keep up with cost overruns). Wouldn't be worried about PC games stopping to work on RDNA 2 and 3 unless you're fine playing at lowest settings, but the lighting could will prob be severely neglected at low settings in 2-3 years time and the gap between low and medium/high will continue to widen, so most people will prob upgrade by then.",5,False,1jcoklb
"> OoO execution (RDNA 4)

RDNA4 doesn't add OoO execution like a CPU has, it allows the L2$ to return data in a different order to which it was requested. Basically if a CU requests data not in cache, then data in the cache, it can return the hit first. Instructions are still all being executed in order, but the benefit is that where one wave's miss could hold up another wave before, now it won't.

> dynamic registers and caches (RDNA 4 has this thinking of a broader implementation similar to Apple's implementation with M3 chips)

RDNA4 doesn't act like the M3 which can configure SRAM as either registers or cache... rather a shader can just allocate less registers than the worst-case scenario. E.g. if there's a branch and one path needs more registers than another. It's particularly relevant for AMD's ray tracing implementation as it tends to compile all rays into a single uber shader, so it previously had to allocate registers for the most complex material shader that existed. Now it only needs to allocate for whichever material it actually hits.

As for Nvidia countering it, they already have a similar feature, though it's more rudimentary and not as granular as RDNA4's implementation.",11,False,1jcoklb

I am not looking forward to RMAing it after reading stories like yours. If i can't get it replaced? I am fucked out of $430. Way to go, Intel! I have been purchasing their CPU's for years. My previous, now backup system is a slightly overclocked and stable 7700K and before that i was rocking a highly overclocked i7-920 for nearly a decade.

You really want to stick it to them?  Take them to arbitration.

In fact, form a site to find people with the same claims, then give them all the information about arbitration.  Maybe even hire a local firm to file cases in the correct jurisdiction!  Gather the claimants together, then have everyone all file arbitration at the same time.  (Or batches of 1000 every Monday at 4:30PM for weeks on end so that you make the Tuesday news deadline.)  Because did you know that Intel has to pay the arbitrators fee under their agreement?  They have to front the costs for the arbitration AND they have to pay the costs for THEIR LAWYERS to show up to arbitration.  In some jurisdictions they have to pay those fees EVEN IF THEY WIN absent some kind of malicious actions by the plaintiff!  

Say you gather 10k people, or even 100k people.  Minimum for arbitrators is...$2500?  Some places it's $5k.  OK, $25M on the low end $500M on the high end.  JUST TO START.  

Now, lawyer's fees...they won't be able to handle this with their in-house attorneys so we're talking firms.  Probably...junior associates?  Let's use averages.  Getting billed out at $600 an hour, supervised by a partner at $1200 an hour?  Say minimum of 10 hours per case prep for the junior, 2 hours partner, document/docketing fees, then also time at arbitration.  I'd say for just one case you're looking at around $13k to just have the arbitration over the course of 1 day.  Then follow-ups, additional prep/responses/evidence gathering, investigations (gonna have some PI and failure analysis of random sampling that pops that up), etc.  Say a nice solid $18k per arbitration.

Now those mass arbitration cases don't just cost $500M, they also cost AN ADDITIONAL $1.8B at the top end, maybe $700M at the low end.

So low end looking at just under $800M, high end around $2.3B.  All for grass roots action arbitration!

"I said this in my other comment [here on another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/s/UQyUW85Fov) but the issue pertains to the decompression of the game files via the Oodle game compression tools. I list a bunch of examples from other games. 

[Warframe added Oodle to their game in 2020](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1223735-the-great-ensmallening/) to make the game smaller:

> The technology we’re using is called Oodle Texture and we’re extremely pleased with the savings we’re getting: our files are roughly half the size on disk and the visual differences are negligible.

Texture compression will affect shader decompilation. There are a variety of different texture compression formats and these will affect shader decompilation. [Here’s a blog post with a few examples.](https://themaister.net/blog/2020/08/12/compressed-gpu-texture-formats-a-review-and-compute-shader-decoders-part-1/)

Oodle is also a built in feature of Unreal Engine. This is probably why it’s most common in those games, though it can affect games outside of UE5 as well.

An example of this causing GPU shader compilation issues is the TLOU PC port which [also had issues with shader compilation stutters](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1250dn7/psa_for_tlou_p1_pc_port_uses_a_bugged_version_of/) and performance issues solely due to the incorrect version of the Oodle library used there. 

Another is Remnant, [which had Shader decompression issues](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1282100/discussions/0/3809533247343255978/) and also utilises Oodle. 

Now I’m not entirely sure what specific error is thrown by Warframe when it crashes but CS2 also throws an nvgpucomp64.dll error [as seen here for example.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/7221029098485351290/) I don’t think it uses oodle but source has its own compressed file format and decompression algorithm. 

As you can see the error is a null pointer exception. This means the memory addresses are incorrect in the decompressed data that is placed into memory. 

So all signs point towards the decompression of game data being corrupted. It is worth noting that games had similar issues with decompression on Ryzen 1st generation, which was notoriously unstable with even compatible memory. That issue was fixed when Zen 2 came out and fixed a lot of the memory incompatibility and stability problems that Zen 1 had. 

So it might be that Intel needs to fix their memory management and how data is actually passed around on the chip itself.

All we know thus far though is that to replicate this issue consistently is that you need to use an Intel CPU and a game that utilises heavily compressed data using Oodle. Most AAA UE5 games will tick this box because Oodle is included with UE5 by default.

To anyone having this issue try doing this:

- Open Intel XTU
- Change the performance core ratio down a few steps to x53 (or lower, if still unstable).

* XMP/EXPO profile is not guaranteed to work on any combination of cpu/motherboard

* XMP/EXPO is not guaranteed to work on MB and CPU that claim it works , even for specific CPU+MB combination where ventor saids so on QVL

* using XMP automatically increases voltage of your IMC, increasing power draw, temperature and shortening its life span (if it works)

    * adjusting these setting manually goes from terriroty of implicit overclocking to explicit one, tripping warranty void clauses (is it court tested?)

    * just by using XMP you might implicitly void your warranty, if vendor is aggressive enough

* even if xmp works at initial setup point, its reliable operation or even continued operation cannot be guaranteed long term.

I am someone who was burned literally by XMP on 8700k ( on by default MCE feature + XMP voltages slowly degraded IMC over few month of active operation, that cpu never ran XMP speeds again).

Then once again EXPO on 7950x3d was worthless headache -> voltage fiasco risks, temps, increased training times and memory getting unstable over time until retraining was forced again.

A reason why this situation changed is that, from a certain point of view, CPUs nowadays come already pre-overclocked.

Also, RAM overclocking has also been way more finicky for far longer than CPU overclocking.

"I ... watched a couple of videos about snapdragon x elite laptops.

Linus's one was one of the most positive, tbh, together with dave2d and I think it depends on the perspective you have on this product.

As Linus says, their review can't be everything for everyone, but in general terms, i think these new generation of laptops are first of all something that didn't really happen in the last what, 30 years, that a new player enters the windows space and actually makes a compelling product.

Sure, if you get into the compatibility stuff, i think things are generally good, but definitely not as good as the platform itself.

and this is where the difference between Linus and Josh is.

Linus probably focused more on the overall product and the platform (hardware), whereas Josh felt more of a letdown because of the software issues, which, is more of a Microsoft problem (and we know microsoft is kinda crap in software), so...

My personal opinion is that these new laptops are good, but they have to be a bit cheaper in order to get traction.

i know they are slim, they have good battery life and good performance for the money, but it's a freakin' first gen product with actual software limitations that you cannot get over, so that is a big minus.

So, sell me a 800$ lenovo yoga slim 7x and maybe i'll think about it. But for 1200$...no thanks, i'll just buy a ryzen 8845hs with the same specs, the same price and take up the 20% worse battery, but 100% software compatibility.",29,False,1dzakof
"overall a good response from LTT and I also shared similar thoughts in the previous thread here. I can't help but to point out again that qualcomm is less efficient at the higher power brackets (i.e. worst case scenario), but intel is most efficient at the higher power brackets (i.e. best case scenario). So when he insists that efficiency of both processors are similar when running cinebench, he is vastly minimizing the differences between the two, almost to a point where it seems with dishonest intent. Most users will absolutely see a much bigger difference in their experience.

The ""day one completeness"" thing is really just a matter of expectations. it's too much of just an opinion/subjective thing to be doing a video dunk about.

it's so crazy that he just casually says that LTT Labs should go and buy the tools, as if LTT Labs wouldn't have had already tried it. And like they say, if LTT did put in the qualcomm CPU power draw data in their video, it would indeed be a ""High Severity"" error dunked on by the community for measuring it differently from their x86 CPUs.

In another video, he was comparing two identical Dell XPS 13"", one with Intel 155H processor and the other with Qualcomm X Elite. He was doing the exact same testing on both, ie, installing the same software, clicking on the same thing at the same time, etc. At one point, he looked at the battery of both, and the Intel had \~44% remaining while the Qualcomm had \~67%.

Yes, there was a lot of tests the Qualcomm laptop sucked at, particularly in running Python code and other dev-related tasks, but overall the battery difference definitely stood out to me.

"I completely agree that full load battery tests are questionable.  In addition to being quite rare workloads, they're also very sensitive to tuning in a way that you rarely see benchmarkers talk about openly enough. If you care about performance, then you'll run those workloads at a power level that's way past the optimal efficiency point - but that's OK, because that's what you *want*.  If you care about maximum work done on one battery charge, then you'll run in some kind of power saving mode (though which one is best isn't always obvious, at least in windows).  And even then - if you're limited by bulk computational throughput, are you really going to use a laptop primarily, not some remote machine? Are you going to *also*  use the machine interactively, i.e. have the screen and input devices powered on?

Even *if* you're the kind of user that's doing some kind of heavy load locally on a laptop for extended periods of time and wants to do that on a battery, just how likely are somebodies cinebench results to be predictive of your experience?

For example, the ""[Just Josh](https://www.youtube.com/@JustJoshTech)"" test lists using power draw in performance modes, but that to me seems like a misconfiguration for a user trying to actually do a lot of heavy loads while on battery. Explicitly configuring the laptop to use more power than default to increase performance will naturally be less efficient.  News at 11.

It's quite possible that the qualcomm chips *are* less efficient at such heavy workloads than Apple's competitors, but that benchmark is not the way to prove it.

For instance, a 1440p youtube AV1 in Firefox test might result in different rankings from a 1080p mp4 twitch in chrome test. And not just that, these tests are so sensitive to details of the special purpose hardware used to decode the video, which is good if that's what you're trying to test.  But that's just entirely different hardware than the stuff you'd use for office work, browsing, or gaming.  It's even pretty different from video conferencing because that's also encoding and processing.

I'm perfectly happy with the test as a first impression (i.e. claiming LTT malfeasance here seems like a eyebrow-raising stretch), I just doubt it'll predict most people's real world experience very well beyond that pretty specific workload.

"Of course not.  AMD is currently the only company with both decent CPUs and GPUs, this is why they won the contracts for several new supercomputers a few years ago and why they make both major consoles (the ones that care about compute anyway).",198,False,1cqa7q9
"Those articles were pure speculation only based on some recent headlines on sales numbers, quarterly reports and rumors. They didn't consider any context beyond that at all. And while there are some new slightly reliable rumors about RDNA4 not having top-end chips, there have been rumors and (unreliable) leaks about that for well over a year at this point, so if it turns out to be true it's a decision they made a long time ago, likely before the RDNA3 launch or at most just after, and not because of recent events.

It should be clear to anyone paying attention that AMD isn't going to give up GPUs anytime soon, they're clearly invested in APUs and AI accelerators at a minimum. Also, putting high-end consumer GPUs on hold for a little while is a very small decision (compared to shutting down GPUs entirely), they're just dropping one out of several GPU chips, and bringing them back should be equally easy. They're still keeping all their existing processes and competencies. They're also struggling to produce enough CPUs and accelerators to keep up with demand, so stepping off the gas on dGPUs seems very logical.",31,False,1cqa7q9

The way I look at it, AMD knows that they are the clear underdog when it comes to them and Nvidia (with Intel nipping at their heels). They know that they are lacking in feature-sets and that they need to catch up to Nvidia's level or come very close in order to claim more market share.

I feel that AMD knows that RX 7000 series cards, while good, should have been better than what they are. They may be using RDNA 4 to test out a new (new to them) solution for RT and maybe other features and if this is successful, to improve on and implement in an even more performant RDNA 5.",7,True,1cqa7q9
"I don't think they would intentionally get out unless they keep losing marketshare. I don't think it was about intentionally leaving, but rather that they are at risk of dropping so low they might have to drop out if things keep being bad.",3,False,1cqa7q9
"> So, the articles we read the other day about AMD getting out of the GPU business are total BS.

the article wasn't reporting on a business strategy shift (or, not a new one).  it was just factually observing the downwards trajectory and continued underperformance/turmoil of the Radeon division, [literally the title of the article (that daniel owen utterly failed at reading lol) was ""radeon in terminal decline""](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amds-gaming-graphics-business-looks-like-its-in-terminal-decline/) not ""radeon leaving the gaming business/desktop market"".  and it's true, unless something finally changes their overall trajectory is downwards and has been downwards for years.

[that trajectory has been obvious for coming up on a decade at this point.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6zrutl/raja_koduri_takes_a_break_lisa_su_to_step_in/dmxntsh/) That if they didn't shape up that they were going to get boxed into a corner (and there is another one I made after he was officially canned re-emphasizing exactly this point).  It just didn't end up being on raster performance, but instead on tensor, RT, and software features in general.  But it literally has been obvious since at least 2017 that NVIDIA continuing to iterate while Radeon stalled was at risk of putting Radeon at a permanent structural disadvantage that persisted across multiple gens.  Ryzen-style leaps are rare, and usually to be successful to the degree Ryzen was requires the market leader to suddenly stall out for some reason.

Like it's the same thing as intel in the CPU division, literally:  ""maybe the product after the next one will be competitive"" is a *terrible* place to be and doesn't inspire confidence, because *everybody* has cool things in early-stage development, and the question is whether AMD's cool things in 2 years will be better than NVIDIA's cool things in 2 years.

the article's point is absolutely correct: unless AMD can make the same sorts of changes they did in the CPU market, and start winning, the trajectory is downwards.  At some point they are at risk of being passed up so badly (eg, by things like DLSS and ML-assisted upscaling in general) that even the console deals are no longer *guaranteed*.  At some point it is viable to just hop to ARM and deal with the legacy stuff separately (maybe stream it).    People take it for granted that AMD automatically gets these big console deals and automatically gets Sony spending billions of dollars on what amounts to R&D for AMD.  If they continue to fall behind this badly it is not necessarily automatic, they can eventually bulldozer themselves out of the GPU market too if they don't shape up.

but in general people are way too eager to say ""leave the market"" and I agree on at least that much.  ""Disinvest"" is a better way to put it imo, still quite an ugly/loaded term but it doesn't imply you're *leaving*, just that it's ""not your business focus"", which I think is more what people are trying to get at.

And AMD has been in a state of disinvestment [since at least 2012](https://youtu.be/590h3XIUfHg?t=1956).  Like yeah 10-15 years of disinvestment and letting the market pass is enough to go from a solid #2 to being IBM and nobody paying attention outside your niche, and eventually getting lapped in the market by upstarts who notice the market gap you're leaving, etc.  NVIDIA or Intel could well have landed a Microsoft contract, and next cycle they stand a decent chance of landing the Sony one as well I think (with continued progress on ARM and with intel improving their gpu architecture).",5,False,1cqa7q9

it's also closer from an architectural standpoint. 4096 shader with dedicated RT and Tensor cores vs 5120 but only shared RT logic and no Tensor cores. 2560 shaders with shared RT and no TCs for 6700XT and only 75% memory and bandwidth is not a reasonable comparison. other specs comparing A770 vs 6900XT (with a grain of salt):

I don't really buy this. I remember way back when I was much younger a friend was building their first computer and I suggested they get an Asus A7N8X because that board was considered the best ""BUY THIS OR WE'LL THINK YOU ARE A DUMBASS"" board on the forums. (yea, people did that back then, too).....

His board was a lemon and they were less than helpful with getting his problems settled. 

Every time I've touched an Asus product since then I feel like it's been kinda crap. The 802.11N router I had started having signs of overheating right after the warranty ended. The little USB DVD drives I bought from them had these stupid stiff springs in their hub mechanism that would crack my old DVDs. The Maximus XI Hero came with atrocious software that didn't really work half the time and about a year later when I reinstalled windows, I couldn't even download the right combination of working software anymore because their servers only gave me part of it (and armoury crate was a shit show).

"> Also when something gets worse over time, it's degradation. Which this is.l apparently.

a chip isn't ""degraded"" because you used too high an undervolt, it'll go back to working fine as soon as you apply the normal amount of voltage.

the problem is that vendors have changed the ac/dc loadline ratios over time, increasing the amount of undervolt they do (gigabyte put this in their changelogs, even), so newer bioses are undervolted more heavily than the older ones.

as more people upgrade to the newer bios over time, it would naturally tend to get worse... and replacing your cpu might well result in a ""fix"" (since newer cpus usually have better silicon quality, or at least are a second flip of the coin).  So the problem getting worse over time doesn't *necessarily* imply *actual degradation*, because the test conditions are different.

but given how many other things are out-of-spec here, it doesn't *not* imply that either... TVB alone means the cpus are boosting to 6 GHz at 20C hotter than they should be, and heat is a major risk factor for electromigration.  Messing with the ac/dc loadline calibration means the voltage/current sensors are wrong too, and the amount that vendors have been playing with the loadline has increased over time too.  And of course all the safeties are turned off.  There's plenty of failure modes here that actually *could* cause degradation. 

But ""more chips are in the very unstable bin over time"" itself is not an ironclad proof of degradation, unless you normalize it for BIOS versions, given that we know vendors (or intel) have been fucking with the loadline ac/dc calibration (which is effectively an undervolt).",5,True,1e09tml

This is for a new contract, which means even the large enterprise services do not have a way to fix the issues yet. Unsurprisingly, the company that received that price quote went with the 7950X systems.

"I think it's more ""before too long the knobs are going to be taken away from you"".  

We are already past the point of it usually doing more harm than good, I think, barring a couple knobs like voltage offset, max multiplier, and power target that twiddle knobs *on the boost algorithm itself*.  3D stacking is going to be a whole other kettle of problems with both really low-voltage signaling between dies, as well as variable heating across the sandwich (causing problems with both electromigration/aging varying across the sandwich, and also physical stress/warping).

The long-term thing is DLVR (and I'm *very* sure AMD will need a thing like it before too long, if they don't already), you run a higher supply voltage and the chip steps it down dynamically at the point of consumption, to the exact level it knows it needs.  And again, the chip will control that.  Letting you twiddle knobs is... optional.

If you've noticed more fatigue on the AOC monitor and you've been using VRR with HDR the whole time, I recommend turning off VRR and see if it changes at all.

"It's about tearing-free motion clarity IMO, with latency benefits.

If you show a 110fps image on a 120Hz display, motion is going to look a *lot* worse than a ""110Hz-native"" display. 120Hz means the display updates every 8.3ms, but 110fps means you need 9.1ms to draw a frame. If you use V-sync because you don't want tearing, that means for every frame you draw, you'll need to wait an additional display refresh before displaying your new frame (since you essentially ""missed the next bus"" and are now stuck waiting at the bus stop), meaning you'll have equivalent motion quality to a 60Hz display.

Now imagine you're constantly oscillating between taking 7-9ms per frame. For everything lower than 8.3ms, you're getting 120Hz motion quality, but then every stretch over that will snap you back to 60Hz quality.

If your display supports custom refresh rates, you can play a guessing game of ""let me set my display refresh rate to 105Hz and hopefully I'm always hitting that target"", and/or mess with game settings, but the reality with how variable games are is that you're never going to really get it quite right and will have to account for worst-case, and changing refresh rates for every game you play is a giant pain-in-the-ass. But if you don't, now you're not actually going to get the benefits of having a monitor able to support *literally double* the refresh rate you're seeing.

Now, you can turn V-sync off, but then you'll have to live with tearing. But the difference between two frames that are 9.1ms apart is usually actually pretty large, especially if you're turning a camera. On a 1440p screen, something moving at 5px/frame across your screen is going to take 2160/5=432 frames to move completely across your screen; at a new frame every 9.1ms, that's 3.9 seconds, which is pretty damn slow. But a 5-pixel shear in the middle of an object is *very* noticeable, and for anything going faster you'll have way larger a shear.

So VRR is about trying to get the best of both worlds here; taking advantage of your screen's innate refresh rate while also not getting a bunch of distracting tearing.

Now, if the games you're playing happen to not drop under your refresh rate, then V-sync with and without VRR will look equivalent. Or if games' FPS are already hovering around half the refresh rate of your monitor anyway. It's within that window that there's quite a big difference.

-------------

EDIT: I should make a note that what I covered above was *double-buffered* V-Sync. In that world, the game is stalled waiting for the monitor to show the frame.

There's also *triple-buffered* V-Sync, where there's an extra buffer that the game can use to draw to even if the monitor hasn't shown its last image yet. However, the problem with this is that the monitor and game are now completely out-of-sync, and so you get bad frame doubling and microstutter issues.

[Look at this graphic](https://imgur.com/a/hMAe9EY) I made that shows triple-buffering; the game takes 4 squares of time to render, while the screen updates every 3 squares. The screen is taking the latest image the game has available, but we'll inherently have to double images because we don't have a 1:1 relationship here (see how red gets doubled, and then the second green).

And notice when the game starts *processing* the image compared to when it's shown by the monitor. Green started 6 squares before, then yellow started 5 squares before, then red started 4 squares before and gets doubled, then with cyan we're back to 6 squares before. So you're getting this wonky relationship between when the game started working on the frame and when the frame actually shows up on the monitor. And the positions of everything in the image relate to when the work actually got processed by the game, so things will move more or less on-screen depending on where in this de-sync we are.

VRR keeps the monitor and the game loop in decent sync, greatly helping these sorts of issues.

">Genuine question: am I the only one that doesn't even notice VRR's upsides?

No, but most people can.

>I think it would just give me slightly lower input lag since Windows already prevents tearing?

no, windows does nothing to prevent tearing. if you turn off vsync, even your browser windows will tear.

VRR enables lag free refresh rate and game framerate syncing. You can already sync a game to your monitors refresh rate, vrr is just the opposite side of that.",21,False,1cdslr4
"> From how it technically works, I think it would just give me slightly lower input lag since Windows already prevents tearing?

I'm not sure what you mean by ""Windows already prevents tearing"". The DWM has vsync enabled by default, but games have bypassed the DWM for some time now, even when running in windowed fullscreen mode. 

If you're leaving vsync on in your game settings, you're not going to notice a difference when enabling or disabling VRR. Vsync removes screen tearing by effectively capping the game's refresh rate to a factor of your monitor's refresh rate. That means for a 120Hz monitor, it'll cap to the highest achievable framerate out of 120fps, 60fps, 40fps, 30fps, etc.. Other than when switching between these frame rates, the refresh rate remains stable. With vsync enabled in game, there is little ""variance"" for it to work with.

Another common issue is if your consistently render games above your monitor's refresh rate, VRR (at least gsync, as far as I know) will actually just do the same thing as vsync, meaning it is providing no benefit, particularly the benefit of removing the input latency caused by vsync. To fix this, you should enable a framerate cap of 3 below your monitor's refresh rate (for example 141 for a 144 Hz monitor) in your GPU's control panel. The difference in input latency can still be hard to notice for some, so if you only play games that render above your monitor's refresh rate, you're probably better off leaving VRR disabled.

"Stuttering isn't very noticeable in loading screens, but flicker is.   Some games have strangely insane FPS variability on loading screens and some menus.   Flicker can be very obvious there.

But yes, if I had a 240Hz monitor, I'd likely disable VRR for games with issues; 240Hz+ feels pretty good even without VRR.    Jumping between 60/80/120/240  frame pacing isn't bad at all.    Not like the 'old days' where a 60Hz non-VRR monitor meant jumping between 20/30/60.

Put another way, a missed frame on a 60Hz fixed screen introduces a 16.67ms delay.  This is easy to notice.   But on a 240Hz screen, its just a 4.17ms delay, which is significantly harder to notice.  360Hz 4k OLED?

My experience with a 4k@120 OLED is that flicker is mostly bad when I get large FPS drops -- especially if it goes from  > 100fps to < 60fps.  

I'm playing Horizon Zero Dawn now, and that has almost no frame pacing problems, the FPS is very stable, going up or down a little with scene complexity but I don't think I've seen anything less than 80fps, and its usually 100+.   No flicker at all.

Hogwarts legacy had a few times I noticed flicker, but it was rare.  Its crazily CPU bound in some places -- 45FPS with a 7800X3D in one random cave!  usually 70 to 80fps ish.  It is saved mainly by the fact that its variance isn't huge in any specific scene.  In an area where its lower FPS, its not fluctuating to 120 then down to 50, its just chugging along at 50-60 for a bit.   Then in another area it will be a constant 80.

"VRR is to prevent tearing when frame rate isn't matched to your display refresh rate. It's not exactly designed with the intent to resolve terrible frame time pacing.

"Its not really what VRR is all about.

Imagine you have a 120Hz monitor.  VSYNC on.

Now you're playing a game that has a perfectly smooth 100fps.

With VRR:  your screen updates at 100fps.

Without VRR:  your screen displays 5 frames at 120fps and then 1 at 60fps.  (assuming the game renders ahead and buffers, which impacts input latency)  Pacing is inconsistent.

VRR helps the above situation a lot and it has nothing at all to do with inconsistent frame times.

Here is another example that is the opposite, inconsistent frame times where VRR doesn't help:

120Hz monitor.

A game that is 120FPS with 30FPS stutters.

VRR doesn't help at all!  Without VRR, you'll get the same frame pacing as without.  A 120Hz monitor without VRR can display at 120, 60, 40, 30, 24, 20 Hz by holding the same frame for multiple intervals.

In the real world, unstable frames are rarely perfect divisors of your screen refresh, but at the same time, stuttering from 120FPS to 31FPS isn't going to look noticeably better on a VRR screen than one without -- both are going to be pretty bad.

So no, VRR's main benefit is smooth pacing of frames when frame rate isn't constant and varies slowly.

For example, a game that varies slowly between 100 and 115 fps is going to look a lot better on VRR than a fixed 120 or 144 monitor.

Just because something isn't reaching 60fps, doesn't mean it's unstable.

You might have a game that happens to run your computer at a reasonably stable frame rate, slowly drifting between 40fps and 45fps. Without VRR on a 60hz mode, you will either get tearing, bad frame pacing or VSYNCed to 30fps.

But VRR will display fine at exactly the correct refresh rate. And because it's stable, you shouldn't see any flicker even on a monitor prone to VRR flicker, as long as it's just slowly drifting over time.

"You're right that I was only covering double-buffered V-sync; I should also make a note about triple-buffered V-sync.

Triple-buffering isn't adding input lag, though; it has less input lag than double buffered, since it's always saturating the GPU and then taking the most recently-completed image. But as a side-effect it's causing terrible microstuttering and frame doublings; [here's an image I made](https://imgur.com/a/hMAe9EY) showing the frame timings of triple buffering.

Yes it is. Thats not debatable, you can use nvidia control panel to disable vsync and your browser windows *will tear*. Thats how vsync works. the gpu controls all of that.

>The Windows desktop as far as I know does VSync without a frame limiter and the extra frames just get dropped.

No, thats not how that works. applications (specifically, their presented windows) are rendered at the rate they refresh at. playnite even currently [requires you to disable gsync](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/125) because it renders at a lower refresh rate and many monitors flicker at lower framerates, which is what the video in the post was about.

>You'd need exclusive fullscreen with fullscreen optimizations disabled to get tearing.

None of this is true. any rendered window can tear. You only need to disable v-sync. You can change fullscreen optimizations to whatever you want, it only handles how the window being presented is handled by the windows DWM, as in, whether or not it fully dominates the monitor it is or whether it displayed in parallel with everything else.

Not to be offensive at all, but you dont know enough about the topic. V-sync at the driver level handles whether or not any rendered content tears. Thats what its used for, and there is no mechanism for displaying content without letting the drivers, and by extension, the gpu, to handle how it is displayed.

extra frames dont get ""Dropped"" either. They never get ""dropped"" unless you exceed your monitors refresh rate, and even those aren't ""Dropped"" they just arent displayed because they never get sent from a buffer to the monitor. That buffer gets flipped and is instead overwritten by a new frame.

i didnt address *""Edit: to be clear I'm not talking about game vsync.

">I mean that for example when playing CS2 in fullscreen, I get no tearing on a 120 Hz monitor. Also unrestricted, not unlimited to be exact.

Then you are either using vsync or cannot tell. it is okay to not be able to tell, the higher your refresh rate goes, the harder it becomes to see.

>Intel's PresentMon records dropped frames: ""Indicates if the frame was not displayed"". In CS this is nonzero, which only makes sense if Windows is doing VSync without tearing. When e.g. playing WoW my frame rate is so low that no frames are discarded so the dropped column is zero, but there is still no tearing.

I think theres some misunderstanding of what vsync actually does here. tearing is not caused by ""dropped frames"". it is not caused by rendering at a lower refresh rate than your monitor can display or a higher refresh rate. it is caused solely by delivering a new frame while your monitor is still in the process of displaying the frame it currently has. You can only have no ""dropped frames"" while being below your monitors refresh rate by adding additional buffers, eg. triple buffering or more. 

There is *no way* to push an image to a monitor and not have it tear without vsync. it has nothing to do with dropped frames.

>I only get tearing in e.g. CS:GO when playing exclusive fullscreen with optimizations disabled.

Im really not sure what to tell you here. Vsync works at a driver level. Microsoft has no, or at the very least very little, control over whether or not v-sync is enabled. If you go to your driver settings, whichever they are, and force v-sync on, there will be no tearing. Whether its windowed, fullscreen, or fullscreen without optimizations, there will be no tearing. Short of you not meeting your monitors refresh rate anyways, as in order to use vsync you either have to use gsync or meet its refresh rate or atleast half its refresh rate for triple buffering. There is fast sync from nvidia, but thats just vsync without a framerate cap - it just sends the newest frame that is ready when the monitor finishes its refresh, and it has its own bag of worms with frametimes.

"One issue is judder, where due to the next frame not being ready for the display the previous one is displayed another time. 

Another is similar to judder, where motion in the image appears to slow down and speed up sporadically because the images are rendered at different speeds but displayed at a constant rate. So one frame might be 10ms old at time of display, and the next frame could only be 2ms old at time of display, but they are each displayed 15 ms apart. You would want the first frame to be exactly 15ms older than the new frame, but it's actually 23 ms older, because the first frame was rendered so quickly.

And on top of that you get a disconnect from your own inputs to what you see on screen due to this inconsistency, making the game feel clunky.

VRR fixes that by displaying the frame whenever it is rendered.

First, you focus exclusively on software but forget to take hardware into account. While we can only agree that locked bootloaders etc are bad, even in the name of security, some hardware can just be too old or too limited (not upgradable) to make sense.

as you probably do a lot, you can take a 10 year old intel quadcore laptop, put in 16 GB of cheap memory and throw linux mint on it and you got a great old system, that will run most everything you want and be responsive.

meanwhile tablet hell doesn't have upgradable memory and has locked down bootloaders and lots of other ways to try to prevent 3rd party os to work nicely on it.

i'd argue the soldered in memory is just another MAJOR way to create e-waste.

memory breaks and not having enough system memory is one of the or the major factors making hardware obsolete, as you of course know.

"Another big part of the problem is how *awful* modern software development is. Companies look at advancements in hardware development as a method of reducing software development costs rather than as an opportunity to expand on software capabilities. Double the performance doesn't mean new features, it means less dev time! Henry Petroski said it best: “The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry.” 

Of course, this was inevitable. The software industry is largely dominated by publicly traded companies. Imagine you are a CEO of one of these companies. Your company is [legally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.) beholden to your shareholders first, your customers and employees second. Shareholders expect profit to grow each quarter, they expect the level of growth to increase with each quarter as well, and they expect you to project this trend to continue into the future. This is fine in the beginning, when the market is new and there are millions, if not billions of potential customers to sell to. But infinite expansion in a finite world isn't sustainable. Eventually, you are going to run out of new customers, or the number of potential customers will be dwarfed by your existing customer base. Sure, you can still make decent money selling updates and improvements to existing customers, but there are only so many avenues for growth there. You could expand into new markets, but unless your revenue from the new markets dwarf the existing ones in size, this isn't going to enable the growth that you need. If you want to meet shareholder profit expectations, you have to start cutting down on costs. And in the software industry, you only really have one cost to cut down: Development costs. Downsize your standard 15 dev teams to 10 each, and replace most of the experienced developers who demand higher salaries and better working conditions with fresh out of college, inexperienced devs. Also make sure they are all H1B visa workers, cause threatening to fire someone for not meeting deadlines isn't *nearly* as good for ""motivation"" if they don't get kicked out of the country over losing their job. Adopt new software frameworks like Electron, now your web development team and app development team are one and the same! Who cares if the apps are bloated, slow, and eat memory for breakfast? Half your customers don't even know what memory is, and they'll be replacing that *ancient* 3 year old device soon enough anyways. As far as bugs and lag are concerned, so long as the experience of using the app isn't bad enough to make it worth your customer's time to switch to an alternative, you'll still get their money. It's okay if your customers *hate* you so long as they still *pay* you. And if you refuse to take these steps, you'll be replaced by someone who will. 

This problem isn't exclusive to the software industry, but is rather a systemic problem, a function of modern economics. We place growth above all else without realizing that all growth comes at a cost, and that cost increases the more you grow. We've been very lucky with computer hardware; the cost for exponential growth has been very little for a long time thanks to Moore's Law and the constant formation of new markets for tech companies to expand into. But the free lunch with new nodes is over, and the blue ocean will eventually run dry. The ""fun"" has already begun, and it's only going to get worse over the next few decades.

OP says they volunteer to refurbish this stuff but they can't be bothered to do a lineageos installation. You can make a script to do it faster, it's not like the end user is doing it. It's volunteer work. Nobody is entitled to someone else's time so I'm not saying that they have to do it, but my sympathy goes out the window when they dismiss other people's hard work and call it crap rather than just admit that their reluctance to sit through an installation outweighs their deep concern for the environment that they spend the rest of the post tugging themselves off over.

I have seem my own very corporate company and numerous others like Boeing fall on their face because they thought they could just do math and that 10 - 2 would be 8. They go lean on pay and create barriers to bringing up staffing in their value added manufacting, as if it were a cost center they can streamline where they get 8 by taking away 2 from 10. Over time this completely fucking guts their value added activities, because most of the people who are really strong at their job also have the strength to just choose not to work there and their overall manufacturing staff self-selects to be circus of clowns who eventually can't seem to do anything right. This happened at my place and Boeing, but the news from Intel is less staff competence trouble and more just low staff and WIP sitting around and inadvertently being damaged by lingering on the floor. Not paying whatever it takes to bring in enough capable staff may be where they tried to subtract 2 from 10 here - and **no excuses:** train people in well paid apprenticeships if you can't find ""qualified"" applicants, pay your senior operators good money and good benefits so they stay on to mentor apprentices.   

Now, because they pulled 2 out of 10, or didn't add the final 2 to hit 10 in their value added environment, Intel is having the agonizing lesson that in value added manufacturing activities 10 - 2 often equals 20. Realistically speaking, the company could have added the 2 (or not pulled it out) and still been solvent.

The impact of this refusal cannot be overstated.

On top of that, TSMC became a giant, thanks to Apple’s business, Apple essentially funded TSMC fab R&D. At this point, Intel had a true fab competitor in terms of cutting edge for the first time in decades. And at that very moment Intel fabs shat the bed and TSMC started to pull ahead.

"> I don't see any issues on the design side, other than bad QA on Raptor Lake. They're a bit behind, but not enough to be a big problem

Absolutely gotta disagree here.  Handful of examples off the top of my head:

* Sapphire rapids had infinite steppings and [still had transient-power-spike problems when released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HJu5xt43iQ&t=3603s) (ignore the host and just listen to the guest). [Leo of KitGuru said the same thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1L_0NQps3k&t=432s) This is part of why the workstation xeons have completely dropped off the radar (intel technically released it but with *zero* press sampling or coverage), and [the workstation variant supposedly had a refresh coming to fix this.](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-xeon-w9-3595x-hedt-cpu-spotted-with-60-cores-and-4-6-ghz-clock)  750W sustained load turns into 1500W+ transients with silly long hold-up-time requirements.  They are not kidding about needing a 1500W PSU on the workstation chips.

* 2.5gbe consumer chipsets - what was it, three revisions of I-225V and then I226-V also turns out to be broken?  I think they finally just had the kernel team and microsoft turn off off EEE/802.3az on their hardware so it would actually work.

* Puma modem chipsets.  Same sorts of issues, never worked right.

* AVX-512: not only was it removed after launch, but is there *ever* a plan to bring it back?

* DLVR: originally supposed to be in Alder, finally coming in Arrow Lake?  And this probably would have prevented the raptor lake problems, if they had gotten it working, because then the ring wouldn't have to run the same voltage as the core (it could be stepped down locally from the core rail).

  * I actually am not overly worried about arrow lake if DLVR is finally working.  (If.)

* This can't be really sourced but, I think there have been rumors/indications of packaging problems for a while. I think that was part of what's slowed Sapphire Rapids down a bunch and I think it's hit Meteor Lake too.

Like I literally have the exact diametric opposite take here, it's honestly hard to think of intel products that are executing well right now.  Client (laptop and desktop) was the bright spot.  And it turns out even that was just a walking-dead phase where the systemic collapse wasn't quite obvious yet.

You know how there's that thing where Intel does some business unit, gets no traction for years and years, sells it off (strongarm, modems, a million other things) at a massive loss/for pennies on the dollar, and then it suddenly becomes a major success?  I think that may be less about Intel being the most unfortunate company in the world, and more about them just being chronically mismanaged and unable to get the traction on their product.  Nobody else really wants to enter the market when the 800 pound gorilla is occupying it... and as soon as Intel is no longer in the picture, someone else turns around the business unit intel sold off and makes a huge mint, or launches some new product that has some huge success that Intel didn't.

The statement that they have removed all impacted processors in the supply chain by early 2024 kinda directly implies some 14th gen chips have it, since 14th gen was launched before early 2024, and some of them would have been sold by that date as well. 

>which is concerning since they have not announced affected batch numbers.

That's over ONE YEAR! At that rate there could be no effort at all as if it was all planned. You know, the earlier you fix your mistake the lesser the impact (early recall of affected batches), yet they chose to ride the wave continue selling hopefully nobody noticed.

If not because of that God knows what's going on.

"Very interesting. Hope some news outlet or YouTuber actually picks up on this one. This is a good story to look further into.

Edit: As some others have brought up, just having the trademark owned by MSI Computer Corp isn't definitive proof that this is MSI the AIB partner, but it's certainly suspicious. MSI would probably be listed as Micro-Star International on any trademark or copyright documents. 

I don't understand nearly enough about copyrights and trademarks to speak with much authority on this, but a Google search for MSI Computer Corp specifically shows that it is a subsidiary of Micro-Star International.

Hopefully some more knowledgeable people can weigh in on this, but with some of MSI's shady business practices being brought to light recently thanks to TechTeam GB and Gamers Nexus, I can't say I'd be totally surprised by this behavior.

Edit 2: did a little quick googling. 

The Amazon store page for Starlit Partners lists their address as

901 Canada Court
City of Industry
CA
91748
US

The official MSI website lists their American office address as:

Address: 901 Canada Court
City of Industry
CA 
91748

Tel: 1-626-913-0828

It's interesting. I mean, Starlit Partners could have just put MSI's American address as their address to try and appear legitimate, but can you do that with Amazon Stores? Unsure. Still an interesting situation that needs to be looked into further.

So the only thing that can save MSI here is if someone pretended to be them to register this trademark or someone is misusing the trademark, both of which are totally possible but why bother with the name ""Starlit Partner"" instead of going all the way and using MSI? Just to troll people into thinking it's _maybe_ MSI when it's actually not? Seems like a waste of time.

https://www.whois.com/whois/msicomputer.com (registered to someone @msi.com, hmm?)

Note that https://starlitpartner.com has a valid SSL certificate for service.msicomputer.com, which means the same person who runs service.msicomputer.com also runs starlitpartner.com (otherwise the missing private key for the cert would make it unable to serve traffic). Its IP address is 64.183.18.126. service.msicomputer.com's IP is 64.183.18.124, an unlikely coincidence.

So, is service.msicomputer.com owned by MSI? It seems so:

https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?search/71229/&q=msicomputer.com&o=date

So either Starlit Partner is MSI, or there is an enormous conspiracy involving numerous support reps at MSI giving a phishing URL of msicomputer.com, and someone who purposely put a false name and false address in a ton of different places when registering the domains starlitpartner.com and msicomputer.com, and also somehow hacked the real MSI servers to obtain the private key for their legit SSL certificate and then somehow managed to buy a nearby IP address, and also cloned the entire website mostly for no apparent reason other than to make MSI look bad in this one case where they are scalping 3080s, and they would have to do it starting years ago before the 3080 was even conceived of, and indeed even before the 2018 mining craze.

Personally I buy B stock as often as possibly when doing upgrades. I find the B stock hardware has been tested more thoroughly to ensure its actually fit for sale as B stock and I tend to have fewer problems.

"That's a great point. However, I'm gonna have to follow through on the same point and logic.  

Amazon and Whole Foods have different leadership teams. Amazon has a product that they do not allow Whole Foods to sell - just for simplicity's sake, let's say Amazon does not allow Whole Foods to sell Amazon-branded footballs. It doesn't matter that there are no Amazon-branded footballs, nor that Whole Foods doesn't sell footballs, because this is just an exercise in logic.  

So it is Amazon's policy to not allow Whole Foods to sell Amazon-branded footballs. However, the independent leadership team at Whole Foods has decided that they want to sell Amazon-branded footballs.   

*Somebody at Amazon has to actively make the decision to accept the purchase order from Whole Foods for Amazon-branded footballs.*  

It could be that the idea to sell Amazon-branded footballs at Whole Foods originated entirely within the Whole Foods leadership. However, Whole Foods is not able to act on their desire to sell Amazon-branded footballs without explicit cooperation from Amazon, as the only way to receive Amazon-branded footballs for a price at which they can make a profit is to purchase them directly from Amazon.  

It could be that the idea to sell MSI RTX 3080s through Starlit Partner originated entirely within the Starlit Partner leadership. **However, Starlit Partner is not able to act on their desires to sell MSI RTX 3080s without explicit cooperation from MSI, as the ONLY way to receive MSI RTX 3080s for a price at which they can make a profit is to purchase them directly from MSI.**

More senior management doesn't want to deal with requests like ""we broke a refurbished 1650 can we have a replacement from general stocks?"" so giving the seller a small float of general stock simplifies things.

Shaq, fucking' SHAQ, show 63% from the free throw line in that series. 

Chris Webber was pathetic. He shoots better from the free throw line, they win and that's not even questionable.

Chris Webber is a career 64.9% free throw shooter. Yet the one year they actually have a chance he chokes, just like he did in Michigan, shooting nearly 20% worse from the free throw line.

The Kings shot more free throws over the course of the series than the Lakers. They also had more fouls called in their favor.

Game 3 gave the Kings a 20 free throw attempt advantage, Lakers lose by 13.

Game 5 gave the Kings a 10 free throw attempt advantage, Lakers lose by 1.

The Kings didn't win a single game in which they didn't have a 10+ free throw attempt advantage.

Game 6 wasn't even the worse reffed game of the series.

In Game 5, Shaq fouled out in 32 minutes of play. In those 32 minutes of play, he shot 1 free throw. It was the lowest amount of free throw attempts that he ever attempted during the playoffs while a member of the Lakers. Mitch fucking Richmond who played 3 minutes shot more free throws than Shaq did yet the only reason Scott Pollard's ugly ass ever played was to go in there and foul Shaq and that dude played 11 minutes.

In Game 6, the Lakers shot 15 more free throws than the Kings, yet the Kings missed MORE free throws than the Lakers did! 

In Game 6, the Kings missed 7 free throws. They lost by 6 points.

In Game 6, the Kings intentionally fouled the Lakers 3 times at the end of the game (which the Kings were still in) giving the Lakers 6 extra free throws, cutting that 15 free throw attempt advantage down to only 9.

The refs rigged the game for the Lakers to the point that the Kings were within 1 point with 11.8 seconds left! What a massive fuck up by the crooked refs who almost let the Kings win! 

Mike Bibby had a chance to tie the game with 4.6 seconds left and fucking bricked it. The Kings wish they had a Robert Horry, but instead they had Peja and Bibby.

In Game 7, the Kings fucking straight up choked. They shot 2 for 20 from the 3 point line. That's worse than Slava Medvendenko's career 3 point shooter average of 15.4%!!!

In Game 7, the Kings were 16 for 30 from the free throw line. They lost by 6 points! They literally could have won the game by making their free throws at the rate of a average high school boys basketball team.

The Kings version of Robert Horry, Peja Stojakovic, was 0 for 6 from the 3 point line in that Game 7. He had a chance to put them up by 2 with 11.8 seconds left but he bricked it. He didn't even get to play in overtime after his pathetic performance.

Or on the other hand, take EVGA, who sells their own 'refurb' stuff through their own store.  Their prices on the used/refurb stuff shot up a lot too.  GPUs as a whole would be considered a shortage their, as demand far outpaced supply.

>There won't be a big WAN Show segment about this or anything. Most of what I have to say, I've already said, and I've done so privately.

>To Steve, I expressed my disappointment that he didn't go through proper journalistic practices in creating this piece. He has my email and number (along with numerous other members of our team) and could have asked me for context that may have proven to be valuable (like the fact that we didn't 'sell' the monoblock, but rather auctioned it for charity due to a miscommunication... AND the fact that while we haven't sent payment yet, we have already agreed to compensate Billet Labs for the cost of their prototype). There are other issues, but I've told him that I won't be drawn into a public sniping match over this and that I'll be continuing to move forward in good faith as part of 'Team Media'. When/if he's ready to do so again I'll be ready.

>To my team (and my CEO's team, but realistically I was at the helm for all of these errors, so I need to own it), I stressed the importance of diligence in our work because there are so many eyes on us. We are going through some growing pains - we've been very public about them in the interest of transparency - and it's clear we have some work to do on internal processes and communication. We have already been doing a lot of work internally to clean up our processes, but these things take time. Rome wasn't built in a day, but that's no excuse for sloppiness.

>Now, for my community, all I can say is the same things I always say. We know that we're not perfect. We wear our imperfection on our sleeves in the interest of ensuring that we stay accountable to you. But it's sad and unfortunate when this transparency gets warped into a bad thing. The Labs team is hard at work hard creating processes and tools to generate data that will benefit all consumers - a work in progress that is very much not done and that we've communicated needs to be treated as such. Do we have notes under some videos? Yes. Is it because we are striving for transparency/improvement? Yeah... What we're doing hasn't been in many years, if ever.. and we would make a much larger correction if the circumstances merited it. Listing the wrong amount of cache on a table for a CPU review is sloppy, but given that our conclusions are drawn based on our testing, not the spec sheet, it doesn't materially change the recommendation. That doesn't mean these things don't matter. We've set KPIs for our writing/labs team around accuracy, and we are continually installing new checks and balances to ensure that things continue to get better. If you haven't seen the improvement, frankly I wonder if you're really looking for it... The thoroughness that we managed on our last handful of GPU videos is getting really incredible given the limited time we have for these embargoes. I'm REALLY excited about what the future will hold.

>With all of that said, I still disagree that the Billet Labs video (not the situation with the return, which I've already addressed above) is an 'accuracy' issue. It's more like I just read the room wrong. We COULD have re-tested it with perfect accuracy, but to do so PROPERLY - accounting for which cases it could be installed in (none) and which radiators it would be plumbed with (again... mystery) would have been impossible... and also didn't affect the conclusion of the video... OR SO I THOUGHT...

>I wanted to evaluate it as a product, and as a product, IF it could manage to compete with the temperatures of the highest end blocks on the planet, it still wouldn't make sense to buy... so from my point of view, re-testing it and finding out that yes, it did in fact run cooler made no difference to the conclusion, so it didn't really make a difference.

>Adam and I were talking about this today. He advocated for re-testing it regardless of how non-viable it was as a product at the time and I think he expressed really well today why it mattered. It was like making a video about a supercar. It doesn't mater if no one watching will buy it. They just wanna see it rip.  I missed that, but it wasn't because I didn't care about the consumer.. it was because I was so focused on how this product impacted a potential buyer. Either way, clearly my bad, but my intention was never to harm Billet Labs. I specifically called out their incredible machining skills because I wanted to see them create something with a viable market for it and was hoping others would appreciate the fineness of the craftsmanship even if the product was impractical. I still hope they move forward building something else because they obviously have talent and I've watched countless niche water cooling vendors come and go. It's an astonishingly unforgiving market.

>Either way, I'm sorry I got the community's priorities mixed-up on this one, and that we didn't show the Billet in the best light. Our intention wasn't to hurt anyone. We wanted no one to buy it (because it's an egregious waste of money no matter what temps it runs at) and we wanted Billet to make something marketable (so they can, y'know, eat).

>With all of this in mind, it saddens me how quickly the pitchforks were raised over this. It also comes across a touch hypocritical when some basic due diligence could have helped clarify much of it. I have a LONG history of meeting issues head on and I've never been afraid to answer questions, which lands me in hot water regularly, but helps keep me in tune with my peers and with the community. The only reason I can think of not to ask me is because my honest response might be inconvenient. 

>We can test that... with this post. Will the ""It was a mistake (a bad one, but a mistake) and they're taking care of it"" reality manage to have the same reach? Let's see if anyone actually wants to know what happened. I hope so, but it's been disheartening seeing how many people were willing to jump on us here. Believe it or not, I'm a real person and so is the rest of my team. We are trying our best, and if what we were doing was easy, everyone would do it. Today sucks.

Yes, they're an ""unboxing"" channel.  They explicitly don't do proper reviews.

"I just want to highlight one important thing Steve mentioned in this video: they have turned OFF monetization in this video, and did not have a sponsor spot either. This is *exactly* how you do it, and again GN serves as a benchmark for ethics and best practices in the industry. They’re making *no* money off this video. They do not benefit monetarily from it directly (sure maybe it brings some more attention to GN in general, but that pales in comparison to direct compensation). They’re not stirring up drama to profit off it, but rather using their platform to draw attention to a problem that we’ve all known about for some time but haven’t seriously addressed. 

To be clear: LMG is not some magical company. Can you think of many companies that have expanded at the rate that LMG has while completely maintaining the quality they had previously? I sure can’t. Especially not ones meant to be “journalistic” in nature. I mean, just think about it: think about all the bills and added pressure to LMG in the last couple of years. Mortgages, salaries, inventory, equipment; it goes on, of course the pressure is way up, they have to make a certain amount of videos and sell a certain amount of products a week to make sure they can pay their bills, and in that quest the right thing or accurate thing (which may take more time) comes second to just getting it done. 

This was a totally expected outcome for anyone who has seen a company expand like this before, and I’m glad GN was the one to finally stand up and speak about it, especially in the way that they did turning off monetization. Hopefully the new CEO at LMG can help and they can get back on the right track. It’s about time.",49,False,15r1oh8

Then, instead of admitting that he messed up, he doubles down claiming to be an ""expert"" on water-cooling and shit and basically tries to squish the little company like a bug under the boots of his multi-million dollar 'business' empire.

We've heard that writer pay isn't high (not to say low), and the channel is definitely entertainment first these days, so I would assume that most of the writers are communicators first and tech hobbyists second.

That's not a problem, but looking in it sometimes seems like the only layer of quality control is Linus*. And to put it bluntly, I get the impression that he's built a cult of personality at LMG that just makes less and less sense as the company gets bigger, and so it feels like he's trying to swing the personality card with the weight of the company behind him. GN mentioned previously how LMG is bigger than most of the companies they review and ultimately needs to be treated as a company and not an individual.

We can also see by his own words he is a horrible and selfish person who feels his actions are 100% excusable no matter how much they damage others.

To even attempt to reframe the damage he did to Billet Labs as him trying to HELP THEM EAT, goes to show he is a proper horrible person. Yes, the best way to HELP a start up is to misuse their product, tell everyone it’s trash and stupid and have them lose all the work they’ve invested into their start up. What a vile mindset. As humans or “real people” we have to take accountability of the bad choices we make. Not attempt to pawn them off as “bad takes” or “other peoples opinions”. If we make a conscious choice to misuse something, that negates everything from that point forward. Even if they forward the proceeds from the auction off, that wasn’t LMG’s property to auction. To try to spin that in anyway other than “we made a horrific choice that hurt good people” is unforgivable. It only goes to further prove Linus is not someone people should be looking to for any reason.

The problem is that the product was NOT objectively tested correctly. It was totally scuffed, Adam didn't bother following the instructions that were given, didn't even have the correct hardware to put the cooler on and then made remarks about performance on that??

"This comment will probably get buried as the thread is more than 24h old already, but since it's the last chance to discuss it here, I may as well say something. 

userbenchmark is significantly over-criticized on reddit. I agree their cpu rankings are wacky. And if they have really been picking fights with prominent reviewers, then that strikes me as distasteful. But even so, userbenchmark still has a lot of utility in what it really is: a free, lightweight, easy to use, *accurate,* and relatively comprehensive tool. But let's talk about one thing at a time. 

The #1 criticism of userbenchmark by far is their cpu rankings, specifically the fact that they overweight single-core performance and underweight performance above 4 cores and even more so performance above 8 cores. Again, I agree with this. However, you can still see and compare the actual benchmark scores, i.e. the 8-core and 64-core scores, of every cpu on the database, and those scores are as useful as ever. This imo is the most important thing that 99% of ubm's critics seem to either not realize or purposely neglect: ubm's rankings and their actual benchmarks are two different things. And what about their GPU and SSD benchmarks? Aren't those still good? Isn't, for example, the data they collected and made publicly available on hundreds of drives' sequential read/write, 4k read/write, sustained write, still good? 

ubm's critics also never seem to mention the utility of its benchmark tool. If you ever want to check something you got from ebay or hardwareswap, or want to check if one of your parts is underperforming, and by how much, you can use their free benchmark tool and find out if the 1080 you bought on ebay is really a 1080 by comparing your results against the bajillion samples they have on hand. It's free, it's fast, it's 6 Mb. It's not a stress test or a test of *sustained* performance, at least in regards to your gpu and cpu, and these are important to have as well, but it's good for what it does. 

To add to that, userbenchmark is comprehensive, relatively speaking. I think at least one other commenter has touched on this already, but basically, if you want to compare a 7870 vs a 2070 super, or 4690k vs 3600, you can do that on userbenchmark, while you may be hard pressed to find those comparisons elsewhere. 

Even if you just read the comments in this thread, it's clear that many of UBM's critics don't completely understand what userbenchmark is doing wrong, let alone the scope of what the site actually provides. Of course, ubm has its faults, for example it doesn't replace benchmarks of the actual applications that are important to you, and I put little stock in their database of self-reported game FPS. But looking at the big picture, it's a way better tool than the reddit of today is giving it credit for. 

With all that being said, what about discussion of ubm being banned on r/hardware? I don't think it's a completely unreasonable or bad thing, although my reasons for saying so are perhaps different from the mods' reasons for banning it. bizude wrote ""posts involving UserBenchmark aren't producing any discussions of value. They're just generating drama"" and I tend to agree with that. After all, I don't even really click on posts or comments about userbenchmark, at this point kind of know it's just a horse that a certain portion of us never gets tired of beating. And I'm not the kind of person who thinks that ""freedom of speech"" is some kind of ultimate good that should be preserved at any cost.

>by allowing userbenchmarks post you still educate people because clueless people will find out its a shitty website

This, at its core, is one of the fundamental reasons why censorship and de-platforming arguments are valid. When the audience is going into a conversation looking for **guidance** because they don't know enough information on the topic to gaurd against **mis/disinformation** then they're not capable of ""finding out its a shitty website"". It's in fact the *opposite* and they will more often than not go to the website, see the easy UX and slip into using it as a main source rather than a supplement to the 'discussion' on the sub-reddit. 

My line of work allows me the opportunity to deeply study human pattern, thought process and motive behind why they do the things they do, and the unfortunate truth is common sense and logic is absent from a large demographic of the world, and humans are generally *extremely* susceptible to confirmation bias, dunning-kruger and manipulation, even at the cost of their own benefit and beliefs. 

Put simply: The expectation that a user will come into every discussion looking for alternative perspectives and think critically about all of those positions **objectively** isn't the reality. A user will more often than not go to the path of least resistance, and are usually not capable of stepping beyond the veil of non-absolutes to form their own opinion based on multiple sources.

Now the more complicated (and to me, interesting) topic is *who* should decide what topics are de-platformed and censored, and *why* should they be allowed to do so. What is the reasoning and intent behind their decision, and how can we ensure it doesn't become abused in the opposite direction.

For example, comparing the i7-8700K and the Ryzen 5 3600X, their scores are within a couple of percent of each other across the board until the i7 is overclocked on UB. If we take a look at Tech Deal's comparison video between the two, ([https://youtu.be/n0uB17Io2is](https://youtu.be/n0uB17Io2is)) we can see that the two chips indeed trade blows in many games and it's back and forth with mostly minor variation from a relatively level playing field.

You'll find that I never mentioned IPC.  Intel's total performance is still higher, in gaming. 

If IPC were all that mattered, we would all be using Apple A13 processors.  Their IPC is still higher than AMD.  Can't clock as high, of course, but clocks don't matter, right?

Also, ""struggling to get data in and out of the core fast enough"" is in fact an incredibly relevant point that affects IPC.  IPC is not just a measurement of the theoretical algebraic performance of the core, it's a measure of instructions retired per clock.  If the core frequently has to stall for a couple clocks and wait for the memory controller to feed it data so it can process the next instruction - that affects the number of instructions retired per clock.

The memory latency of AMD processors does in fact negatively affect their IPC in gaming.  this is in fact enough to lower their IPC below intel processors in these workloads.

>Actually it does - the display needs to upsample it and convert to RGB for display purposes. Traditional lossy compression involves quantising frequency components, and I'd argue that chroma subsampling is really just a form of spatial quantisation, hence a form of lossy compression.

Just had this discussion [here](https://new.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/8rlf2z/psa_4k_144_hz_monitors_use_chroma_subsampling_for/e0sk2s3/). Chroma subsampling is basically the same process as just lowering the resolution of the image. I'm not really concerned with the ""legal definition"" of compression, my point is that it's not at all comparable to what most people think of when you say ""video compression"" (i.e. H.264). It should be thought of the same way we think of reducing the resolution and upscaling from that; most people would not consider that ""compression"".

"It's pretty convoluted, which is why I didn't bother to explain it. Didn't want to bog it down with *too* much unnecessary confusing detail xD

The three numbers A:B:C specify a rule for the horizontal and vertical resolution that will be used in the chroma components. The same rule is applied equally to both of the chroma components, Cb and Cr. It tells you how many horizontal and vertical samples you will have, for every *A* pixels wide and 2 pixels tall.

*A* specifies a certain number of pixels. The choice of number is sort of arbitrary, it's only there for the second and third number to be compared to. In most cases, 4 pixels. So we are looking at a group 4 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall.

*B* specifies the number of horizontal samples in every *A* pixels. If it's the same as A, then that means full horizontal resolution. If it's 2, then that means half horizontal resolution.

*C* specifies the number of new samples in the second row. If it's the same as B, then that means full vertical resolution. If it's 0, then that means half vertical resolution (because the samples from the first row span two rows, so there are 0 new samples in the second row).

So,

* 4:4:4 = for every ***4***\-pixel-wide 2-row block, you have ***4*** horizontal samples, and ***4*** different horizontal samples on the second row. So, full horizontal and vertical resolution. No subsampling. (i.e. 3840×2160)
* 4:2:2 = for every ***4***\-pixel-wide 2-row block, you have ***2*** horizontal samples, and ***2*** different horizontal samples on the second row. So, half horizontal but full vertical resolution (i.e. 3840×2160 -> 1920×2160)
* 4:2:0 = for every ***4***\-pixel-wide 2-row block, you have ***2*** horizontal samples, and ***0*** new samples on the second row (meaning the samples span 2 rows vertically). Half horizontal and half vertical resolution (i.e. 3840×2160 -> 1920×1080)

"Frankly I don't believe they really support anything of substance from the HDMI 2.1 spec; we had the same issues when HDMI 2.0 was released, receivers claiming to support HDMI 2.0, but turned out to still be limited to HDMI 1.4 speeds (10.2 Gbit/s). This is the reason Rtings added a ""*full* HDMI 2.0 bandwidth"" bullet point to their spec list on 4K TV reviews.

You can basically claim any HDMI version you want, because the HDMI ""version"" has no technical meaning; the HDMI version number isn't a feature that you support or don't support, it's just the version of the document you are following when you design the device. The HDMI Specification is the document that tells you how to build an HDMI device, and version 2.1 of that document is the latest one that includes instructions on how to implement all the latest features. However, there's no mandate that you have to include all (or any) of the latest additions. HDMI designs that were ""within spec"" of previous versions are still going to be ""within spec"" of the newest version, unless they change it to disallow a design that was previously allowed (unlikely).

That is why HDMI Licensing banned the use of HDMI version numbers on both cables and devices back in 2009; you're supposed to list the actual features that you support (HDR, 48 Gbit/s, VRR, etc.) rather than a version number. Obviously, it's not really enforced, but that's the official position.

Most of the time, companies only claim to support a version when they support the main things people expect from it (i.e. 18 Gbit/s support for ""HDMI 2.0"") just to avoid negative attention for ""fake"" HDMI 2.x support (I presume), but there are always companies that try to cash in with a new version number whenever a new version is released, without actually supporting anything that was added over the previous version.",21,False,8rlf2z

I have happily accepted bucket loads of 'faulty' devices which needed nothing more than a teeny tiny spray of oil on the components with moving parts and contacts.  Clicky switches, twisty knobs, clunky sliders.

1. Silver contact material is more prone to oxidation “film” and therefore has a higher recommended minimum current for maximizing reliable operation.

2. Contact plating thickness and thickness consistency. Some switches wear through this plating faster than others. 

3. Poor contact crossbar placement tolerance and/or less resilient contact spring material.

Good micro switches designed for micro loads use gold alloy contact materials with a crosspoint/crossbar contact arrangement. Some high quality switches are made in China and Taiwan and are known to use springs/contacts imported from Japan due to high quality and consistency.",30,False,o1jvsy

1. When you opened the switch up and messed with it, you inadvertently cleaned the shmutz off the contacts.

"> The only issue here is that, apparently, no one in their senior engineering team is concerned with using a part that doesn't line up to the mouse voltages.

"The 5V parts uses ancient process nodes, has less memory/slower while costing more (larger dies).  e.g. more capable Arm microcontrollers cost less than the old 8-bit.  We are talking about the ~90nm to ~45nm, but the same physic/economics holds.  Companies have been migrating to smaller process nodes with smaller transistors with lower voltages.  It is both economics and necessity as ancient fabs upgrades/sold off/mothballed etc.  Wireless parts are newer designs, so naturally they would use the more economic process.

There are little choices in low current switches to have that kind of feel.  Sadly the switch manufacturers aren't investing into developing lower power switches.  Been there myself as I did notice the minimum current requirement in the datasheet and had to talk to the manufacturer.  I wonder how many designers don't read their datasheets carefully?  (hint: Mice are not designed by senior engineers.)

As switches wears out, the bounce gets worse.  The aggressive low debounce time in those fancy low latency gaming mice become unreliable. There is a easy way to fix the double click issues - just solder in a 0.1uF cap in parallel to the switch.  You'll lose a few milliseconds in latency, but the capacitor reduce the glitches without requiring changing the firmware.  One could at least repurpose the mice to non-gaming use. 

EDIT: Cap slows down voltage transitions.  It'll affect switch opening but not on switch closing. It is a standard trick for debouncing and circuits in noise environments.

The microswitchs are [single pole double throw](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/What-is-a-single-pole-double-throw-switch-SPDT) which are what the old R/S flip/flop [debounce circuit](https://www.hobbyprojects.com/flip_flop/switch_debouncing.html) taught in school uses.

Apple is moving toward serialized components that are tied to the phone, and will _only_ work when they're replaced _by_ Apple with their special software to ""re-bless"" the repaired device.  When the products drop out of the 1 year warranty you mention (or let's be generous and say you pay extra to make it 2 with AppleCare+), you'll have to take them to Apple to get them fixed, at prices high enough that you'd might as well buy a new phone.  _That's_ their endgame - products that, when they die, you _can't_ fix, so you end up buying new products every year or two.

Now, let's expand beyond the ""I'm just replacing a broken screen on an iPhone"" to something like ""I tried to plug my MacBook into a USB-C charger / dock that Apple's firmware couldn't handle, and it fried the whole device,"" as has been happening with the original release firmware of the M1 MacBook. (https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301846/apple-macos-update-prevent-third-party-dongle-dock-damage)  What if you're out of warranty?  

Your options are, in that case, either a $200 circuit level repair (replacing a bad chip that blew on the motherboard), or paying $600+ to Apple to replace the motherboard (at which point you lose all of your data that isn't on the cloud, as well, since the SSD isn't removable and is encrypted with a key stored on-chip on the device).  Guys like Louis Rossmann have the skills to diagnose and replace just the bad components, but they're _literally_ unable to get those chips from companies that produce them like TI, because Apple has strong-armed the companies that produce them into not selling them to anyone but Apple in order to ensure a repair monopoly, even though they're otherwise commodity parts.

Beyond computers, look at what John Deere is doing to farmers with tractors.  It's very similar to the serialization described above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPYy_g8NzmI

"Apple now bakes some chips on their laptops that only work with specific serial number. It also has agreements with chip making composite not to sell to unauthorized repair shops. They are actively trying to put independent repair impossible.

Also, 1year warranty doesn't mean you can't use your device for a decade or more, or that it is supposed to break down eventually.

However, I do want to point out an error in your calculation regarding voltage swing on the decoupling capacitors. The differential equation:
>  i(t) = C dv(t) / dt

is used to calculate the current THROUGH the capacitor. You had the assumption that all current flows through the capacitors, but that makes no sense, since that would imply the capacitors are in series with the GPU, and in that case the GPU would have 0 volt on all its power lines since capacitor impedes DC.

To properly decouple the AC ripple from a DC power source, decoupling capacitors are put in parallel with the DC load, in that way the capacitors can ""short"" out any frequency components of the voltage that isn't DC (massively oversimplified here).",84,False,j09yj5
"I can chime in from the perspective of an EE who has had to deal with these kinds of design and supply issues in the last few years. Generally, I regard tantalum caps as a great way to add a lot of bulk capacitance to a board in a small package and with better high frequency characteristics (lower impedance at high frequencies) than electrolytic caps. MLCC are great because they are very compact and also have great high frequency filtering characteristics but have the downside of not having large bulk values available like electrolytic or tantalum. If your goal is to filter out noise, many small MLCC caps are generally the way to go. Having a physically small package for the cap actually makes a difference: it’s a shorter, more direct path from the power rail to the ground plane and that equals lower impedance at the high frequencies you’re trying to filter out. For applications like this, you would do via in pad routing both because of the space constraint but also because it’s lower impedance and helps the cap filter noise more effectively. Having a trace between the pad and via adds inductance which you don’t want here. From a DC perspective, having many small caps that add up to the same capacitance of a single bulk cap is equivalent. But from an AC perspective, many smaller caps will do a better job due to shorter paths and lower impedance. The supply chain for MLCCs has been bonkers for a while, even before COVID, so there are issues with getting enough caps in the capacity that you need without running into insane long lead times. 0.1uF and 1uF value MLCCs are hardest to get a hold of because they are the most commonly used",84,False,j09yj5

"Here is from my prospective as someone that meddles with power supplies and board level circuits for work.

>PSUs and VRMs are slow. They only react AFTER the voltage drops down.

VRM are inherently much slower than digital circuitry at GHz.  Instead of producing a simple '0' or '1', the VRM have to compensate for a sudden load change and adjust the duty cycle while maintaining loop stability (*). FYI for traditional analog designs, the bandwidth of a power supply is about 1/6 of its switching frequency.  There are limitation of switching speeds, so they are typically in the upper hundreds of kHz.  1/bandwidth is roughly the amount of time it takes to react.  Digital power supplies with DSP technologies as well as multi-phase topology have really speed up the response time, BUT the difference is still between GHz and sub-MHz.

>handle low 75Hz noise, medium kHz noise, high MHz noise, and very high-GHz noise

So energy stored capacitors (and inductors) are the only things that supply the energy for the switching circuits while the VRMs try to figure out what to do next.  For that, you would want some large capacitance values (i.e. your POSCAP).  Unfortunately nothing in the real world are perfect as POSCAP aren't exactly good for really high frequencies and that's where large values of MLCC comes in and the smaller decoupling caps and the inherent capacitance between power/ground layers in the PCB.

A good VRM can cover to hundreds of kHz.  The capacitor banks in question covers MHz to lower MHz range.  There is nothing you can do above hundreds of MHz as it is in the domain of PCB power/ground capacitance.  Because of parasitic, GHz is covered by BGA substrate capacitance and some chip level capacitance. 

As to what are the correct ratios of these capacitors, one have to know the performance of the VRM, the load characteristics of the GPU chip.  Most of the time, even the chip guys won't know about actual real life characteristics until board verification with the final drivers.  So that's why the reference PCB have the different options.  That's where the breakdown happens between Nvidia and its partners - likely lack of communication/feedback to the partner's design team with things they have learnt during their own testing.

>Give me a few hours with a 3080 and a $50,000 oscilloscope and maybe I'll tell ya.

You'll need far more than that and not likely with that time frame nor equipment.   You'll need to have full control of the driver that hammers the power supply.  It is far easier to quantify the ""problems"" frequency ranges and try to simulate it with some fast transient loads that is repeatable for testing out the capacitors.

>Maybe the solution is to fix your VRMs switching frequency.

They might be able to tune the VRM parameters as some of them have DSP these days.

"Probably because it's not true. Electrons don't pass through a circuit and it doesn't make sense to say that one is at 100V while another is at 1V.

As electrons gain energy, they move to outer orbits. If the energy is high enough, it will leap off the atom and move toward a more positively charged field, generally attaching to another atom and causing another electron to leap off. That transition of electrons leaping is the movement of charge, which is current. The movement of charge travels at the speed of light,  but the electron moving travels at less than 1% of the speed of light, which results in a charge propagation rate which is generally 50% to 75% of the speed of light. Different metals and different wire configurations will have different propagation rates. ""Electrons per second"" doesn't make any sense at all without another metric.",8,False,j09yj5
"I mean, yes? But there's a ton of other capacitors there too.

Lets look at the ""Bad"" Zotec card, which uses 6x 330uF POSCAPs: https://www.techpowerup.com/img/QJIGuSTPDbCQ9i7k.jpg

We can see literally hundreds of other capacitors all around those big POSCAPs.

Its clear to me that the POSCAPs are for bulk, low-MHz speed decoupling. There are many, many, many other capacitors there, probably designed for 10MHz, 100MHz, and greater speeds.

----------

Can you really say, without circuit analysis (or even knowing the characteristics of those smaller caps) that the POSCAP is insufficient for the task?

Power-delivery is about the **team effort**, not about any individual capacitor.

Or for a more technical argument: replacing a POSCAP with ~2MHz resonance frequency with 10x X7R with (still only) 2MHz resonance frequency still does jack diddly all by the time 100MHz or 1GHz signals are considered. Those higher-frequencies are almost certainly being handled by the other capacitors.",5,False,j09yj5
"Hi, I'm also an MSEE and I work in the mobile industry, so I can give some FYI for that though it may not necessarily apply to desktop compute.

> Your analysis does not seem to be correct. At 2 MHz, the capacitor starts acting as an inductor instead of a capacitor (f L becomes larger than 1/ (f C)) afaik, this has no influence on noise, but certainly on the circuit behaviour itself. This frequency is called the SRF (self resonant frequency) of the component.

Indeed the cap is most effective at its SRF, where the notch occurs in its impedance.

> That said, the component is a 10uF capacitor. Values this large are often used as decoupling capacitors, positioned close to an IC to smoothen the supply voltage to that IC.

10uF is a relatively ""slow"" cap (given its SRF is ~1-2MHz), and in mobile, serves more so as a bulk cap. 0.1uF caps have their notch at ~20MHz and are put next to or under the IC deal with high frequency transients (with some 1uF+ mixed in). Multiple caps in parallel lower the notch impedance and the impedance/inductance beyond 20MHz. Between these caps and the die capacitance, you are at the mercy of the PCB and package routing inductance and there will be a impedance peak; sometimes there's package capacitors.

OP has gotten most of the general concepts or industry conventions right.",6,False,j09yj5
"Apologies if I got it wrong.

I remember that the self-resonance frequency was an indicator for how good a capacitor was at various frequencies. A capacitor with 2MHz self-resonance will be worse at GHz-level noise than a 200MHz self-resonance cap.

IIRC, the general recommendation was to use a wide variety of caps with different self-resonance frequencies, to ""cover"" different frequencies.",5,False,j09yj5
"Hmm, to bring you up to speed to the various arguments...

Ultimately, people are getting their panties in a twist because one company is using a [330uF POSCAP](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/QJIGuSTPDbCQ9i7k.jpg), while a 2nd company seems to be using [10x 22uF MLCCs](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/DPuP8z6YaDJhEmFf.jpg) (at least, thats what I think is going on).

A large 22uF X7R MLCC won't have the high-frequency characteristics of your .1uF NP0 / C0G MLCCs. But simultaneously, its nonsensical to think that a team of high-frequency NP0 MLCCs could ever provide the bulk capacitance of a 330uF POSCAP.

Would replacing a 470uF POSCAP with a team of 22uF MLCCs even make a difference? I somehow doubt it... but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a difference either.

The high-frequency noise issues pushing into 2GHz would be handled by completely different capacitors elsewhere on the board (probably far smaller capacitors, like 0.1uF on different ceramics like NP0)

"Here’s my take on the whole situation: The availability of MLCCs is not great, and hasn’t been for awhile, so that creates a preference to use parts that have better availability wherever possible. NVidia’s reference design specified either type could be used so the obvious choice for the designer/ops people is to use the more available part (POSCAP). Enter 2 complicating factors: 1. There seems to be a vbios issue that allows cards to clock higher than intended under some circumstances  and 2. In an effort to prevent leaks NVidia did not provide real production drivers to AIBs until very close to launch. The preproduction drivers could not be used for games/benchmarks (to prevent leaks) and the stress testing tool that was made available apparently did not stress the cards in a way that would cause the higher boosting that results in crashes with the particular configuration of all POSCAPs. Some AIBs like ASUS and EVGA did their due diligence when production drivers became available and performed more testing with real world workloads. Now seeing the crashing, they went through the massive effort of tracking down the cause and reworking all their boards before they were shipped out. That’s a Herculean effort in such a short span of time, hats off to them for pulling it off. It’s extremely luckily/wise they used the NVidia reference layout that includes pads for both types of caps otherwise the rework would not have been possible (at least not production quality rework). 

In the end, the blame here lays squarely with NVidia: if they had performed more realistic internal testing they would have found that the all POSCAP configuration was unstable or found the vbios issue. And by pulling the cloak and dagger crap with the drivers they prevented their AIB partners from being able to realistically test their designs until the launch was right on top of them",40,True,j09yj5

Using this technique of two separate masks (different colors of same metal layer), you can effectively have more dense wiring than if you were only using a single mask. I know it can be tough to visualize without a picture or diagram, but it's basically a technique used to bypass the lithography limits and get more dense metal routing than you could otherwise achieve with a single mask.

And you do need to be able to attenuate whatever noise at those frequencies does escape.

"You're proving my point.  This isn't colloquial language.  We're talking about cooling solutions.  This is engineering and physics.  Thermodynamics, to be precise.  Just because you've heard someone misuse the term doesn't validate using the term that way.

It's a very simple distinction: closed loops do not allow matter transfer into or out of the loop.  Open loops do.

A common example of an open loop is a cooler that uses evaporation to the atmosphere as a heat rejection method.  Here you need to constantly supply additional water to replace the water lost to evaporation.  There are also other cooling solutions that will use water from a lake or other large body of water as coolant.

A custom loop cooling solution for computers always has the loop closed.  The coolant recirculates and has no interaction with the environment around the loop.

Honestly thinking about selling my PC (don't want to part it out) since there is such a hardware shortage. I grabbed a laptop with an 8th gen i5, 16GB ram, 1TB nvme, GTX1050 & a 4K screen and I only play Rocket League which maxed out at 4K pretty much held at 72fps in a short test, so playing at 1080p would be no problem at all.

Kinda feel bad, almost like I'm hoarding a GTX1070 & 32GB of ram, and other components someone could use more than me, I boot it up a few times a week for a couple hours of Rocket League and the laptop with a 1050 would be fine for my needs. 

Only issue is if I did this I would like to swap the 1TB TLC nvme the laptops previous owner upgraded from the factory 250GB and clone it to my desktops better 1TB nvme I know hasn't been used much or stressed. But haven't checked the specs, nor do I really want to go through that hassle.

To be fair first thing I did when my 1070 arrived was try to sell on hardware swap brand new for exactly what I paid, or trade for a lesser card and some cash difference (basically cover shipping), but all replies were just wanting to rip me off showing me heavily abused 1070's mined nearly to death that sold super cheap demanding I sell my BNIB card for that price or else, so I kept it with a middle finger extended.

"A driver could infer from the description of the operation of the breaks and of the gas pedal as to what the outcome would be if they used both at the same time with, importantly, the car performing both actions as they are described.

The same is _not_ true for a game submitting commands to a GPU. There is simply no way for you to interpret the graphics API spec in such a way as to expect any combination of commands to cause hardware damage.

Your analogy is totally broken.

The situation is closer to:

> If the user presses the gas pedal turns on the fog lights, and the car performs a backflip, is the car at fault or the driver?

The game is interacting with the GPU via a graphics API which defines all of the valid commands. If it is _at all possible_ for a sequence of commands to be sent which can damage the hardware, then there is a flaw in the API (which is the driver) or the implementation below it.

It being impossible to design a perfect system which cannot fail is imply irrelevant. The possibility of a hardware bug existing does not mean that when said hardware bug is discovered, the software which first encountered it shares some of the fault for the error. The error still lies within the hardware.

As someone else in this thread put it: Blaming the game for the hardware breaking itself while processing rendering instructions is like blaming the customer for the chef tripping and injuring themselves after they place their order.

It is impossible to ensure that kitchen accidents can never happen. The customer knows when they ordered their food that there exists the possibility that the chef might injure themselves while cooking the food. By your logic, the customer shares the blame for the chef tripping and hurting themselves.",5,False,oqmq94

Intel's 7nm uses EUV. On the one hand, the quad-patterning nightmare wont apply to 7nm so a lot of the struggles with 10nm will be avoided. On the other hand, they don't have the level of experience TSMC and Samsung have with using EUV in select layers.

Both of those things allow for etching smaller features, but try to address the problem in separate parts of the process.",3,False,hwnovh
"Photolithography, which is the way nearly all CPUs are manufactured, consists of plastering layers of photosensitive material, applying a mask over it blocking some light, shining some light that either removes the photosensitive material or keeps it there, washing the excess away, and using the mold created to build a layer of your chip by removing parts of the wafer you don't want. This process is repeated many times to build the chip itself.

As chips have gotten smaller, physical phenomena such as [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction) ultimately end up limiting the amount of detail your masks can impart onto the photoresist, and/or how small you can build your masks. you can either use lower wavelengths of light(which end up being complicated because past a certain point they start to behave like X-rays and going through your mask, or even mirrors you're using to focus your light, even though you don't want them to), or build your molds by removing multiple masks at different points in time.

Technology from 2 years back only let you do this reliably with 2 masks - maybe 3 under specific circumstances: masks can fall out of alignment and ruin the fabrication, though this can be dealt with to a limited extent by using partial etching to try to align other masks in place. Intel and TSMC have both attempted to use 4 masks for this in some layers as a way to keep improving densities. TSMC managed to keep production yields acceptably high. Intel couldn't.",94,False,hwnovh
"Photolithography is relatively simple: its a backwards camera. 

Think of 35mm film, if you ever used it before. Your camera transfers the light from reality, the light touches special chemicals on the film and ""stores"" the light.

Now reverse the process to develop the film into a photograph. You shine a light through the film, which causes a chemical reaction on photograph-paper. Chemists have special chemicals that create red, blue, green, and other colors on your film. Once the light is done pushing through the process, you have an old-school picture.

Lets say you shine this film through a microscope backwards. The lenses ""shrink"" the design down by 500x, 50,000x, etc. etc. You can shrink down designs, or enlarge them, with the magic of lenses. That's the basis of photolithography.

Then you use special chemicals to ""etch"" the design onto metal or silicon. When the metal or silicon are shaped in certain ways, you create wires (thin pieces of copper), or transistors. That's all there is to it.

---------

EUV is ""Extreme Ultraviolet"". Instead of using normal light to shine through the film, use instead **ultraviolet** light. Why UV? Because ultraviolet has a shorter wavelength, and therefore can make smaller designs.

How small? Well, a single photon of UV has a wavelength of ~100nm (nanometers).

Uh oh, we want a 14nm process. Well, I guess we can use EXTREME-ultraviolet, something shorter than 100nm so that we can actually make those ~14nm or 10nm designs.

-----------

Quad-patterning is destructive interference. You use your standard 100nm sized UV light, but destructively interfere with each other.

EDIT: Maybe this new link is a bit easier to follow: https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-006-video-demonstrations-in-lasers-and-optics-spring-2008/demonstrations-in-physical-optics/two-beam-interference-2014-collimated-beams/

TL;DR: If you shine two light beams **just right** with **just the right alignment**, they actually cancel each other out.

Quad-patterning uses ""bigger"" light (Lets say, 100nm), and then uses this destructive interference to make smaller designs.

EUV just uses ""smaller"" light.

---------

Both approaches have issues and are very sensitive. That's why its so hard.",62,False,hwnovh
"EUV is a light source used for lithography. It is important because the wavelength of EUV is 13.5 nm, compared to the previous (also current) technology which is water immersion using ultraviolet light at 193 nm wavelength. The wavelength limits the size of features you can print on the wafer. It is easy to type the letters EUV, but actually generating and using EUV is a gigantic pain in the ass. EUV light is absorbed by basically everything, so you have to generate it in a vacuum chamber. EUV is absorbed by basically everything, so you can't use glass or other material lenses to focus the light like you can with i193. you have to use mirrors. and not simple metal mirrors or anything like that, you have to use a special diffraction mirror. look at this mirror [https://www.ntt-at.com/product/multilayer/](https://www.ntt-at.com/product/multilayer/).  expensive. ok great we have a vacuum chamber and special mirrors. To actually create the EUV light you simply fire tiny molten tin droplets across the vacuum chamber near a parabolic focusing mirror and then use high-power lasers to vaporize the molten tin into a plasma, which gives off EUV. 50,000 times a second. and somehow keep tin from splattering all over your expensive vacuum sealed mirrors. remember, you can't cover your mirrors or your mask design with a protective coating because EUV is absorbed by basically everything. ASML makes an euv tool[https://medium.com/@ASMLcompany/a-backgrounder-on-extreme-ultraviolet-euv-lithography-a5fccb8e99f4](https://medium.com/@ASMLcompany/a-backgrounder-on-extreme-ultraviolet-euv-lithography-a5fccb8e99f4)

&#x200B;

So EUV is one way to make smaller patterns. If you do not want to do the above (i don't blame you), you can make smaller patterns by using multiple exposures of higher wavelength light, aka multipatterning. quad patterning is a type of multiple patterning.  [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\_centers/manufacturing/patterning/multipatterning/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/manufacturing/patterning/multipatterning/) There are multiple types, like self-aligned vs LELE. When you do multiple exposures, you get problems because you have to align each exposure very precisely. There are tricks like self-aligned patterning which can help 

&#x200B;

so they are both ways to print smaller features. for a good article talking about EUV and multipatterning try this, although it is talking about using both EUV and multipatterning [https://semiengineering.com/multi-patterning-euv-vs-high-na-euv/](https://semiengineering.com/multi-patterning-euv-vs-high-na-euv/)",21,False,hwnovh

"Photolithography shines light through a patterned stencil to transfer the pattern to some chemical on the wafer. This pattern is then used to place the other materials needed to make the transistors and wires. The wavelength of light that you use limits how dense of a pattern you can transfer. Denser is better because it means you can get more transistors and wires for roughly the same price, so you get more performance.

Quad patterning uses existing photolithography tools which use 193nm light. This means they can't transfer very dense patterns, so they break up the pattern into multiple steps and transfer one at a time. This is super slow and the process of breaking up your pattern restricts what kind of designs you're allowed to have, but since it uses existing technology and tools, it's fairly cheap and well-understood

EUV uses 13.5nm light which is a very new technology and super expensive and unreliable. But it allows you to transfer your entire pattern at once, which saves you a lot of time and lets you have more freedom to design the layout of your transistors and wires, usually resulting in better density (aka better performance).",3,False,hwnovh

"I've made comments disparaging Intel in the past about how they're losing their status in almost all categories where it matters. Intel has been too busy trying to buy its way into new markets to focus on its core businesses, CPU design and fabrication. It's buy-in into IoT failed, mobile failed, and then 5G was an expensive draw at best. 

Meanwhile I tweeted last month how Intel was losing ground in fabrication nodes (nevermind TSMC is building fabs literally next door to Intel in AZ) as well as how ARM just snagged both Apple and multiple supercomputers away from  Intel. It's not good when the top supercomputer in the world doesn't even use x86. Intel will have lost Apple as a customer in two years (a buyer of not just 3-6% of their chips, but often the more expensive SKUs at that), and even NVIDIA was very happy to go with EYPC for its monster DGX A100 nodes. meanwhile AMD is quickly regaining market share with better designs, cheaper platforms, and newer platform technologies in all three computing markets. 

It wasn't good when Intel has to outsource Pentium CPUs and chipsets to TSMC two years ago, and now they're doing it again because they missed a second node in a row. Intel appears to have made the classic mistake of failing to maintain its core business segments in its attempt to brute force its way into new markets, and it has spent a staggering amount of money in the attempts.

"From what I understand, intel is having some issue with one portion of the process on 10nm, I don't know if it's something to do with how they're making their vias or interconnects or something in the silicon they're trying to grow. 

What I described above is an institutional issue. It's the Intel way of approaching abnormalities that just destroys their productivity. Granted, the product they do end up pushing out is of undoubtedly good quality, their obsession with matching the fleet of production tools to one another can cause real issues.

As an example, I was witness to a tool that was performing an etch that ended up with %NU (% non-uniformity in thickness across the wafer) that was *better* than the other tools they had of the same type from the same manufacturer. Instead of allowing the new tool to run and probably end up settling near the other tools with some burn-in time, they prevented the tool from running production until they could match it to the fleet. This took more than two months. Two months of lost production on a tool that could process thousands of wafers a week. For further context, my understanding is that the %NU on that process was in zone 2, meaning it was within 4 sigma. It also bears mentioning how tight their tolerances were, and this should not have been an issue. While I can't state exact numbers, we're talking about tenths and hundreths of a % difference between that tool and the fleet.

It was madness and they actually made the engineers for the tool make the %NU worse to match the fleet, rather than letting it run, or making it the golden tool. 

Wasting time on what should effectively be non-issues is indicative of the culture around which intel actually approaches problems. So again, while I have no clue what the hell is going on with 10nm, as that's R&D, the intel way to approach problem solving and prioritization of resources is quite poor, and their tolerances for what they constitute an issue are so small that most places would look at them and say ""this is absolutely fine"".",21,False,hwnovh

This is especially relevant because at the time Intel was leading in single-thread performance, so they were further in the diminishing returns than others.

You know wrong then, intel does make networking gear, including most high-end network cards outside of very specialized things life Infiniband. And in the server space, Intel ethernet cards are king.

You seemed to have intentionally left out:

> Breaking down the segment, AMD reported that semi-custom sales have dropped while EPYC processor sales are up, underscoring the unusual nature of the segment. Overall, EPYC sales have improved by “double digit” percentages over the previous quarter, an important development for AMD as it works to rebuild its server market share, but it ultimately wasn’t enough to offset the drop in semi-custom sales. AMD of course continues to be gung-ho on EPYC, while the semi-custom side of the segment should improve once AMD’s console customers start ramping up for their respective tenth-generation console launches.

So yes that division is in the red, but the server chips specifically did double digit growth, while the custom stuff (IE current gen consoles) dropped as it spins down current gen chips and starts ramping up next gen consoles.

From my personal experience on AWS, I’m seeing high demand on the AMD instances - their spot prices are constantly moving around and dropping them more frequently as people spin up AMD on demand or reserve instances and it pulls them from spot requests.  This is telling me AWS can’t fill their datacenter fast enough with the AMD chips.

A ""test matrix"" is just the set of different conditions you test your product under.  In theory, it's supposed to represent all the combinations of circumstances that it will face in the wild.

This is why lots of developers don't like giving users options.  You can imagine, then, why having a huge spread of different versions of *part* of your program on user machines is horrifying.

You'd just trunk your vlans to the APs, and in the wireless controller set your SSIDs to use <x> tag for each network. Use PFSense to filter intervlan traffic and do the actual routing. If you have wired backhaul everywhere, might as well have good wifi coverage all throughout the house.

"I mean, that's kinda how the internet works man. Your ISP probably just doesn't have much peering that ""low"" into the residential area to transit between different networks. 

Its like if you and your next door neighbor needed to connect to each other's PCs. Obviously the fastest lowest latency path would be to just run a long ethernet cable directly between your houses, and setup dynamic routing directly. But that's a pain in the ass. There's probably some situations where doing that actually makes a lot of sense, but in general nah not really? So you pay someone else (your ISP) to get network traffic ""out"" of your home network and to other places. So you can see how the traffic between you and your neighbor now isn't taking the most direct path, but it still works. 

It's basically the same thing and same decision making process your ISP is doing at a larger scale. If I do a traceroute right now to random destinations, I'm riding my service provider's internal network until I hit their aggregate router about \~70miles / \~110 km away and transition over to Level 3's backbone. Because obviously my ISP doesn't have a direct connection to every network in the world. 

So if I wanted to connect to my next door neighbor's home PC directly and he was on a different ISP. It's more than likely I'm probably going to go the entire way out to that aggregate router, transition over to Level 3's network, who then probably has a connection to that neighbor's ISP, and come the whole way back over the 2nd ISP's internal network. All those companies are making decisions about where it makes the most sense to hook up their networks to each other. Is there *really* a ton of traffic between my ISP and my neighbor's ISP where they both decide that it makes sense to peer with each other directly in this region? Almost certainly not.

The fact that it builds up on dry surfaces is not evidence that it builds up on the MOIST surface of your lungs, and that anyone here thinks those situations are similar is just evidence that you don't even understand the basics of chemistry. Also vaporizing by definition does not involve combustion so the products of combustion are irrelevant here because if you're burning your vape juice, you're not running your vape right. But still, no one here has even shown that the chemicals in vapes when combusted produce an oil or other substance that can build up in the lungs- Your evidence is seriously that it's difficult to wipe with a paper towel.

Of course, with a little digging, it's a fog machine, but if you told a room of people that the fog machine is pure water vapour, it wouldn't be a hard sell. Doesn't look a million miles away from a kettle.

No.  Memory used in that way is not reported as ""used"" by the usual measurement methods.  If it were, you'd see like 95%+ used unless you measured just after a reboot.

Here's what it looks like on my machine (which is Linux, but Windows should be similar enough):

                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available

    Swap:          3999         698        3301

Those are numbers in MiB.  ""Free"" is the amount of memory that is actually *unused*.  It's a little under 3% of the total.  ""Available"" is the amount of memory that can be given to applications if they need it.  ""Used"" is the amount used by applications (and probably for other purposes that the allocator treats similarly).  ""Buff/cache"" is the amount used by the OS.",3,False,771ero

By delaying the ice age (by about 18 months), this gives the devs more time to work on the PoS algorithm.

and if you look at it economically, resetting the difficulty or lowering it by a significant amount won't increase the profit all that much. When more ether is produced, the total supply would go up, creating a downward price pressure. So any spike in price would be temporary.

So RAM has always since Sandy improved the overall CPU-side performance of our rigs, we just didn't care cause we were always GPU limited.  Always.  The 2500k at 4.2ghz can handle even a 780ti OC in 1080p 144hz gaming with standard 1866 DDR3.

However now we have Titan X(P) running at 2088ghz OC pushing so many megapixels a second at ~240% the performance of a 780ti while CPUs just have barely even gotten 40% more performance.  So many peoples desired gaming experience is now CPU limited quite a bit.  This means any CPU-side performance gain is straight up FPS gain.  This hasn't been the case since Sandy.  It's why i7s are actually ahead of i5s and Ryzen in gaming benchmarks for the first time in a long time.  The i7s have always been faster, but were just never needed cause the GPUs couldn't push em.

So if you are running 4K 60hz gaming on a 1080ti, you can run 2666 CL15 DDR4 and it won't matter.  You are GPU limitted at all times anyway.

But if you want to run one of those new sick Acer Predator XB251HQT at 240hz 1080p gaming (the same mega-pixels per second as 4K 60fps) it's the exact same horsepower needed as 4K60 fps on the GPU side, but requires pretty much 3 times as much CPU performance to run (most of the CPU work are per frame tasks.  The amount of work to render a 4K frame vs a 1080p frame is almost identical).

So now you pretty much need an 8700k, delidded, under strong cooling, overclocked to the max, and you still wont get 240hz in most AAA titles even though the GPU can do it.  Bumping your RAM to like 3600 CL16 from 2666 CL15 will net you big gains, cause you are essentially 100% CPU-side limited.  

It hasn't been tested very heavily yet cause it's such a niche area, but that RAM bump will give you >10% increase in average frames, and probably upwards of 30% in 0.1% minimum fps in many titles.

Which if not for high end DDR4 being retardedly expensive atm, it would be worth it.  As it stands, the price/performance gains there are just not quite worth it.  Which sucks.  The the performance gain is there for anyone who wants the best regardless of price.",6,False,771ero

I will definitely return the SK Hynix trash, and will possibly also return the previous downgraded model too. That means there's 1-2 empty M.2 slots in my computer soon.

So I'm now in the market for:

- 2 terabyte M.2 SSD
- With high-quality, reliable (high TBW endurance) flash, mainly looking for top branded flash like Intel/Micron and Samsung
- With around PCIe Gen3 speeds (so around 3200+MB/s sequential read and 2500+MB/s sequential write)
- Good controller with DRAM which can sustain fast reads/writes
- And TLC flash (absolutely not QLC flash).

Any suggestions/recommendations?

Perhaps it's time to pay a bit extra and jump directly to some Samsung TLC model? But they're usually overpriced due to their brand recognition...

OP is making a huge deal of this without understanding what's happening. SK Hynix is by no means a ""low quality manufacturer"", they're a major player in consumer and data center SSDs. Their 96l NAND is on par with Intel/Micron, and significantly better than Samsung's overstock 533MT/s 64l NAND that had the worst performance (the ""v3"") in Sean's (TH) testing.

The reason why OP is seeing slow speeds is because they're using the PCH connection, which is a well known issue with SMI controllers + X570 boards. The CDM album literally shows the discrepancy between CPU and PCH lanes even with the older drives, but OP attributed it to the drive being full (doesn't matter when you're doing a quick CDM run that won't exhaust cache) instead of doing a backup, wipe, and retest to see that the PCH is the issue. They straight up didn't test the newest drive on a CPU lane before writing this post.

Tldr this is a giant angry misinformed post about nothing. OP should have tested on CPU to see that the speeds should be identical to the ""v2"" with the 2262G and Micron 96l NAND.

Disk performance is also determined by controller speed and arrangement (e.g., four channel vs eight channel) as well, and some vendors skimp out on performance in order to prioritize density or reduce material cost.

Their S31/P31 products are genuinely [great drives](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16012/the-sk-hynix-gold-p31-ssd-review) for the price (if you'd have been looking for a 1TB drive, the P31 would have been a strong recommendation), but most of their products are aimed at the datacenter. They don't really have a retail enthusiast model in the category of the SN750/EVO Plus.

It's similar on the consumer DRAM side of things. They have solid value offerings, but nothing as scalable as Samsung's legendary 8Gbit B-Die.

It really is unfortunate that companies do this sort of thing, as I'm typically a firm believer in simply choosing the best part for the job; surreptitiously swapping out elements that result in loss of performance is a major problem, as it invalidates trust.

The sad fact is that with companies being as large as they are, having a reputable track record is something of an exception rather than a rule. Someone else mentioned Western Digital's SMR/CMR disclosure fiasco. MSI has had half a dozen scandals in the last year. Crucial had issues back in the day with their M4/M500 SSDs. Seagate has had plenty to atone for.

Samsung makes solid SSDs, but had past issues with some 840 EVOs. And DRAM price fixing. And the other DRAM price fixing. And also the *other* DRAM price fixing. And minor high level embezzlement. Also their CEO is currently operating the company [from prison](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210126006000320). Samsung has more institutionalized drama than the British royal family.

"Yes, the SN750 is the Gen3 variant. Being a TLC drive with psuedo-SLC caching, it will drop to a lower steady state write rate on extremely large transfers, but still maintains [some of the highest performance](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3WHZoPJ4fj5zcUuANxm2JQ-2560-80.png) ([1TB model](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn750-ssd,5957-4.html) shown, but representative of the 2TB), falling just shy of the 970 Evo Plus. WD, like Samsung, also uses their own in-house controller which is quite good, and pairs it with solid DRAM cache (amusingly, quality SK Hynix DRAM on the WD).

MLC drives like the 970 Pro are able to maintain the same native write rate throughout the entirety of the drive's capacity, but are much more expensive and effectively limited to 1TB since Samsung never released a 2TB 970 Pro to retail. The Optane drive in that particular graph is unfazed entirely, as it doesn't use traditional NAND at all.

During most normal usage, this sort of performance fallback isn't really encountered, as most transfers take place within the psuedo-SLC cache space and are then committed in the background automatically. As the drive fills up, it can become an issue towards the last portion of unallocated space, but you'll always have that effective native NAND write rate floor of \~1.5GB/s.

As far as heat, Tom's Hardware and a few other review sites have also noted that both the 970 Evo Plus and SN750 will indeed thermal throttle at around 80°C, which should only occur on sustained writes (reads do not stress the controller in the same manner, and are also ""free"" as far as durability is concerned). This can sometimes happen in systems where the drive is mounted on the back of the board (as in the user review you linked to), but shouldn't be an issue for your board.

The SN750 *is* available in a [variant with heatsink](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-wd_black-sn750-nvme-2tb-internal-pci-express-3-0-x4-solid-state-drive-for-desktops-only/6338997.p?skuId=6338997), but as you've got an MSI X570 Unify, you already have [integrated heatsinks](https://www.vortez.net/articles_pages/msi_meg_x570_unify_review,5.html) for each available NVMe slot. Both drives come with heat conductive metallic labels and you can simply pop either one directly under your board's heatsinks.

Ultimately it comes down to whether or not you're really after peak Gen4 performance. If you are, go with a 980 Pro or SN850. They're both very good drives, but quite expensive. If you don't need the high sequential transfer rates (and most day to day operation does *not* involve this type of usage) save a few bucks and go with a Gen3.",4,False,lk2f5i

Although I don't know how they can wiggle out of the fact that the SK Hynix flash can NEVER reach those speeds no matter how many wishes and kisses you throw at it, so it's still false advertising now. Same with the TBW endurance rating since it definitely can't be the same anymore.

"Thank you so incredibly much. It took me a while to digest and go through the information. You are very kind for writing such a detailed review. And it helped very much.

I see from your graphs that the Samsung 970 Evo Plus is indeed quite a lot faster at sustained writes and has a larger Pseudo-SLC buffer so it deals better with heavy desktop workloads (like moving a 50gb game or movie to another drive).

You also completely helped explain the heat issue. I see now that the MSI Unify heatsinks are able to reduce Temps at load by 5-10c. I had been reading old 2017 info about very bad, thin, early MSI heatsinks that increased Temps. But they fixed that pretty fast and by now the Unify generation's are several evolutions onwards from that and are very good. That is a relief for the Samsung 970 Evo Plus.

I also realized that the guy who was throttling has mounted his SSD on the back of the motherboard, as you said, which I now see means that his SSD is literally hugging the PC Case motherboard mounting plate without any airflow. Wow no wonder he was throttling!

In my case, all slots are on the front, with good heatsinks, and very good airflow that goes from the front radiator to the rear of the case. In fact, one of the slots is at the same spot as the GPU fans, which means the GPU will pull extra air over it as the GPU fans spin. I read someone saying that having M.2 near the GPU fans can actually lower Temps even more. But if it turns out that the airflow is bad there, I can always put the current ADATA system drive there (the good Micron one), since I barely ever do heavy loads with that drive.

So the Samsung drives could go in the bottom-most and in the topmost M.2 slots if necessary.

All of this means that I will most likely never throttle any of them UNLESS I run a ridiculously long transfer which I basically only do if I am moving data between SSDs, which is rare.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the Samsung 970 Evo Plus is my best choice, as it has the highest quality, reliability, and performance compared to the SN750. The extra Samsung heat is probably mostly because its flash is writing a lot faster than SN750. But I am confident now that my case and airflow can handle them.

Alright, I am going to contact my retailer and start arranging a swap of the ADATA scam drives to two Samsung 970 Evo Plus' instead.

Okay, so the original poster /u/Sorteport made a few mistakes. **LUNA** dropped 99% in a week, not Terra. Terra has only dropped like 60%.

Terra (aka: UST) is a stablecoin designed to be $1 at all times. Don't ask why, just... understand that the cryptocoin community wanted this.

Terra / UST is ""supported"" by Luna. Whenever UST goes above $1, an algorithm / robot on the blockchain would automatically sell UST for Luna, then buy Luna with real-world US Dollars. Effectively creating a really, really complicated ""deposit scheme"", saving ""real world"" US Dollars into the coin.

When UST goes below $1, the algorithm would reverse the process: it would **fabricate** Luna out of nothingness, and then sell it for real-world US dollars. In theory, this was ""balanced"", $1 in would end with $1 out, so everything should work, right? 

Well... a lot of people knew it was a bad idea. But Luna/Terra community believed in this (and so did a lot of people apparently), so $18 Billion later, we got this giant collapse.

---------

All was well for over a year. Then on Saturday May 7th, people noticed UST was depegged, at like 98-cents per dollar.

By Monday, the peg was ruined all the way to 90-cents. So Luna's owners liquidated $1.5 billion worth of BTC on the market to prop up Luna (and also prop up UST).

It didn't work. After 3 hours of this ""propping"", it looks like people lost hope, and UST dropped all the way down to 60-cents.

The algorithm went crazy at this point. Luna was being ""printed"" non-stop, billions of Luna was being minted into thin air and sold in a feeble attempt to get UST back up to the $1 peg.

The rest is history. So much Luna has been printed its only worth 30-cents now.

"> No, they're designed to do that.

This is definitely not true for at least some cards - VRAM cooling generally is secondary in GPUs and assumes that it's being hit with workloads about as much as the main chip. Then the fans are governed by temperature at the chip - so they might not be running very hard when mining ETH even though the VRAM is being hammered as hard as possible.

That's brutal.",141,False,uno632
"It's not an algorithm, it's profit incentives for people to make the trade, the collapse happened because the incentives were no longer good enough for people to play the game any longer.

Demand for LUNA was artificially propped up by the biggest user of the platform: a 20% APY Ponzi scheme called Anchor where people deposited (""staked"") cryptocurrency in the system for high returns.

Here's a much more concise and accurate description of how Terra/TerraUSD worked:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/un9kyl/how\_the\_lunaterra\_scheme\_worked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/un9kyl/how_the_lunaterra_scheme_worked/)

> There are two coins at play here:

 >  Terra LUNA, which I'll just call Luna, a regular crypto.

> Terra USD, also known as UST, an 'algorithmic stablecoin' designed to maintain a value of 1 dollar.

> The way the 'algorithm' works is pretty simple: You can burn 1 dollar worth of Luna and get 1 newly printed UST, or you can burn 1 UST to get 1 dollar's worth of Luna. That's really all there is to it.

> As a result, whenever the price of UST is more than 1 dollar, people burn Luna to get UST at 1 dollar each, sell it for a slight profit, and bring the price down to 1 dollar. And when the price of UST is less than 1 dollar, people buy UST and burn it to get 1 dollar's worth of Luna, driving the price back up to 1 dollar.

> The clever ones among you probably have one big question mark for this system: Why should Luna be worth anything at all? And that's the key to understanding what's going on right now.

> The system is built on the fundamental assumption that there is real money demand for Luna that you can sell to to maintain the peg. If there isn't, the whole thing collapses. So the people behind Terra/Luna burnt through billions in VC money to pay absurd interest rates (20%+) to people to 'stake' UST, encouraging people to buy Luna, convert it to UST, and then lock it up. The goal here was to grow incredibly big this way, scale down the staking interest, and then... well, presumably everything would sort of sustain itself once they were a big stablecoin? There didn't seem to be a real plan there.

> So how did it unravel? Well, I can't say what the cause was for the initial dip in UST price, but the resulting mechanism was as follows:

> When the price of UST dropped below 1 dollar, people starting arbitraging it. Hard. This means they burn the UST for 1 dollar of Luna each, then sell the Luna for a profit. And keep doing this as long as it's profitable. The problem is that selling all this Luna plummets the price.

> If you pay 90 cents to buy a UST and trade it for 1 dollar's worth of Luna, but that Luna drops to 80 cents by the time you've sold it, you're not arbitraging anymore, you're losing money. So the collapsing price and demand for Luna broke the arbitrage system that kept the peg in place.

> The result of this was a large drop in UST price. As a result, seeing that the peg was breaking, UST holders started massively selling off directly for dollars, or burning UST for Luna and selling that off. This made the price for both Luna and UST crash further.

> And remember: If you burn UST you get 1 dollar's worth of Luna, regardless of how much Luna that is. So the further the price of Luna dropped, the more Luna each UST creates. The more Luna is created, the further the price drops. This is a downward spiral that isn't going to stop.

> As a result of all this, Luna has crashed from $80 less than a week ago to $0.86 $0.20. UST is down to 0.29 from a dollar, because the guarantee of getting 'a dollar's worth of Luna' is worthless when there's nobody willing to buy that Luna.

> TL;DR: This whole system was inherently unstable. It could only ever 'work' while the line goes up.

All these jacked up scalper prices you see resellers selling for?  That's not their choice (or at least, for the most part, maybe 5-10% of it is).  The majority of it is coming from distributors, because distributors aren't answerable to anyone.  Their only customers are resellers, and there's only a handful of distributors (and not all of them sell video cards), so it's not like resellers can look at a price and go ""fuck that, I'll buy it somewhere else"" because there may be only 1-3 distributors that carry a certain brand, so if they ALL jack the prices up, resellers have no choice but to jack *their* prices up.

They're a mining thing. As for it being a defect, the GPU cooling is dependent on how the cards behave in testing, the companies aren't wishing for huge number of RMAs.

And again, even you're admitting that cooling was insufficient for these cards even if you lowered the TDP because mining hammered these cards in specific ways.

About a decade ago, when PS3 and 360 were on their last legs and I was still rocking a pre-LGA Pentium 4, I considered buying a used PS3 'Fat' because it supported so many games that I wanted to play.

But being a PC builder at heart, I was concerned about its repairability. After all, the original PS3s ran pretty hot (huge silicon dies) and by that time period they were starting to drop like flies.

I asked around at various repair shops and the answer I got was that I'd 'most likely' need a donor PS3 to get a PS3 Fat repaired. It was a long discontinued product and Sony didn't give a sheet about the ones still in 'circulation.'

I asked online, same thing. People urged me to cough up for a new PS3 Slim with shrunken dies.

But I wasn't going to drop $200+ on an ancient piece of hardware that struggled to run a heavily watered-down GTA-V at 720p so I built my own used PC with a Core 2 Quad Q9550, 4GB of RAM, and an Nvidia GT240 which was later upgraded to an HD7790 (close to GTX470/560Ti performance).

Never looked back.

That HD7790 ran pretty much all PS3/360 era games at solid, locked 900p60 - if not 1080p60 - without breaking a sweat.

"> Apple: We now class our products as consoles.

that was actually something that came up in the lawsuit over the apple app store... microsoft and sony were parties to the lawsuit and had to argue why they thought apple should have to open up and they shouldn't.  Because obviously if you can use alternate app stores/sideload apps... that threatens sony/MS revenue too, they don't like that any more than Apple does, they prefer the idea of having access to apple's platform and staying closed/locked-down themselves to retain all that revenue for themselves.

And sony doesn't even have the excuse that they subsidize the hardware - PS5 has been sold at a profit since less than a year after launch.

Not that it's really a good reason anyway... if I price my console $1 below cost I should be allowed to utterly eliminate user freedom on the platform?  If it's *free* ok maybe then it's different, you're selling apps and giving away the platform.  But MS pretty clearly is at-most losing $50 or so on the Series X and that somehow excuses them from ever having to open up?  like if Apple did the same and priced an iphone $50 below actual cost (because they make up revenue on app store/icloud) should they also not have to open up anymore?

And sure series S is sold at more of a discount... so if Apple only makes a loss on the base model, but makes a profit on the ones with more storage, do they get to close the store for the premium models because the entry model is sold at a loss?  There are strong, strong analogies between console app stores and phone app stores, it's essentially the exact same thing except consoles successfully made the leap from ""general-purpose computing device"" to ""appliance"" in people's minds so they get away with it.  There's no reason I shouldn't be able to run office apps on a series S, I *bought* the console, I paid money for it, it's legally mine.

and it gets into this weird thing around dumping.  Like it's honestly not the worst thing in the world if the ""sell below cost so you can make it up on recurring revenue"" business model dies.  I am OK with that.  It poisons the well for honest competition like Steam Console etc, because you have companies dumping below actual cost and subsidizing it from recurring revenue, while (eg) Steam Deck can just run windows, so they can't sell it at a loss.  The answer should be ""wow that's dumb of you, thanks for the subsidized hardware but once the user buys it it's theirs"".

Yeah SSDs are dirt cheap right now, 4TB is $190-250 for TLC+DRAM and the older stuff is even cheaper.  So basically 1/4 the tb/$ of spinning rust - which is honestly compelling for a lot of users.  The lower-density 2TB drives you can get 2TB of PCIe 3.0 TLC+HMC (no DRAM) for $73.  Even server builds are cheap, they have those Asus Hyper M.2 cards that let you put 4xM.2 PCIe 3.0 drives in a single slot with bifurcation for $55, and there's a PCIe 4.0 one for $75. 

For gaming stuff I'd definitely give the edge to PCIe 4.0 though... I have a hunch PCIe 3.0 drives will produce more PCIe bus contention with DirectStorage RDMA.  Even if you don't support it end to end today (B450 mobo, etc), if this is your one big SSD purchase for your gaming machine, I'd go Cardea Zero A440/Z440 4TB or FX900 Pro 4TB or whatever.  Get one nice one with tons of space for future games, with PCIe 4.0 capability.  It's cheap right now.

I just see no real reason to fuck around with spinning rust anymore barring very specific datahoarder storage needs.  I have a disk shelf I could load up, if I wanted to (for $60 why not, swapped out the IOMs for standard SAS ones).  If you're not doing that... you probably don't need spinning rust.  Even then, enterprise SAS SSDs are getting very cheap.  Not sure how legit but the WD Ultrastar 7.68TB drives have been like $250 before, and they're faster and higher density (per SAS port) than 2.5"" 15k SAS drives and only 1/2 of the TB/$ vs shucked bullshit.  Why fuck with it.

The only caveat is you can't leave SSDs unpowered for a long time.  But that's also not the best thing for HDDs either... bearing seizing is a thing too, they don't always come back up after a long time cold, even beyond spinup/spindown itself.  But like, portable USB drives and stuff, and flash SSDs, will lose data over time, on the order of 1-3 years.  Portable SSDs don't make good external drives unless they will be continuously plugged in.

GPUs growing out of control is a massive problem for SFF builds though.  They're huge now, barring a handful of specific models.  And the changing dimensions are a pain for SFF builds.  OK I guess it's a... 3 slot sandwich case.  Fuck, I guess 4 now.  And if you leave tons of clearance room... it's not all that small anymore.  You have to build around specific GPUs I guess.  

I don't think any change in sight though when the target market (DIY enthusiasts) almost uniformly have midsize/fullsize ATX cases with tons of clearance.  The only thing that's ever generated any real outrage is some cards getting too big for the O11D.  Even with a trend towards physical damage due to excessive cooler size over a span of a couple years, unless you use a support, nobody seems to really care.  Nothing is going to change unless the dimensions of GPUs are standardized, and the PC market is terrible at that (see: front panel jumpers and PSU-side cable pinouts still being a problem in 2023) and there's disincentives for partners to go along with GPU modularization since it lowers their product differentiation even further.",3,False,13re75l
"> I honestly don't remember that, and i did those repairs, i may have only worked with the earlier mobo revisions though and didn't think it was that difficult as i don't remember using any custom tools.

from day one all the x360 consoles had that style of protection. if you were only working with early consoles though, it's possible that by sheer chance you only ever saw the dvd drives that you could just hook up to a pc and run some software to dump/embed the key. (samsung drives worked like, and from memory i THINK the hitachi drives prior to v78 worked like that as well, but the hitachi drives were crap and would fail all the time)

pretty sure benq was the first drive that required a probe to get the key out.

If you are more of a mortal type and 60Hz will do, limit it to 60FPS AND enable V\_Sync.

If the frame rate is higher than the monitor refresh the GPU will generate frames you will never see.  That is 100% waste of electricity.

If ""V-Sync"" is not enabled, then a frame switch may occur while the monitor is still drawing the last one, the result is a ""tear"" across the screen that usually scrolls and down.

If your monitor framerate is close to ""half"" the generated frame rate you will get a persistence ""tear"" across the screen.  The top of the screen is showing even frames and the bottom is showing odd frames basically.

  
tldr;  Turn ON V-Sync.  Set your FPS to something reasonable.  Ideally a round factor of the refresh rate.",9,False,1jqbogm
"that is some old head advice, but it is not entirely irrelevant in the modern day. 

Most monitors from the past few years, especially those with higher refresh rates or otherwise marketed towards ""gaming"" will have a feature called ""Variable Refresh Rate"" often with brand names like AMD Freesync or Nvidia G-Sync depending on implementation. The feature allows the monitor to adjust it's refresh rate in real time to ""wait"" for the next frame to be finished before drawing, effectively eliminating screen tearing as long as FPS remains within the variable range or (depending on implementation) a multiple of a value within that range. Commonly on high refresh rate monitors the lower limit is 48hz and upper is max of the panel.

While the old advice of targeting just above the refresh rate of the monitor and enabling vsync so there is headroom still applies just fine to these newer displays. It is now possible and usually recommended to instead target graphics settings that balance preferred visual fidelity with preferred refresh rate within range of the display. For example my display is capable of 240hz with a variable refresh rate range of 48hz to 240hz, the high refresh rate has integer multiples of common TV/Movie frame rates and looks nice on desktop tasks or scrolling websites but I almost never get that kind of FPS in a game (unless it's really old/easy, like UT2004). Instead I adjust settings in games so they tend to run between 50-100fps depending on how demanding the game is and where/what I'm doing in the game. For me this strikes a nice balance between fidelity and refresh rate on my upper-midrange PC. This results in zero tearing, smooth gameplay, with low latency (since vsync holds a buffer or two and that is no longer needed, now latest buffer is always shown as soon as it's ready) and maximizes the usage of the GPU. That is to say, instead of keeping 10-20% of it's capability reserved to avoid screen tears on frames that suddenly take longer to draw, you can have a game that is almost always 10-20% smoother and if/when a frame takes longer to draw the monitor essentially just waits until it's ready instead of showing a torn frame. In fact it is recommended to set an fps limit slightly below the max refresh since VRR will still tear when FPS exceeds max refresh without vsync, setting a cap just a little bit below max means that slight instabilities in frame pacing will not exceed the monitors capabilities. i.e. with a 165hz display it is recommended to set a limit at 160 or even 150 either in the driver's control panel or in game fps limiter when available. If you are worried about lower refresh rates falling below the lower limit, better implementations in monitors support a feature called ""low frame rate compensation"" that holds frames for a multiple of the refresh rate range when FPS is too low. i.e. with a range of 48-165, if the game is running at 42fps it will refresh at 84hz but show each frame twice, or maybe even 126hz but show each frame thrice, depends on the monitor. 

VRR is IMO one of the more important innovations to come to PC gaming as of late because it allows gamers to take fuller advantage of their hardware and makes tuning the graphics settings easier and more personalized. It is especially useful on weaker systems where every bit of performance counts and lower refresh rates where frame tears are more noticeable since they spend longer on screen. 

The only real downside to VRR is that some oddball games are buggy or have horrible frame pacing that can freak out the display controller. For example I have encountered that java minecraft specifically with my setup will fluctuate rapidly and wildly between 120-200fps, which results in my display's brightness fluctuating kind of like a ""flicker"", vsync breaks it even more somehow. It's a known firmware/panel issue with no planned patch from the display manufacturer. So my fix is to set minecraft to run uncapped but limit framerate to 480 in amd's control panel, and enable amd's ""enhanced sync"" which basically lets the game run ""unlimited"" (or in my case up to the limit set earlier) but keeps a buffer of the last complete frame. This lets it fluctuate between 300-400 fps but by keeping the last finished frame in a buffer results in no tears, normally this would waste a lot of power but luckily minecraft is easy graphically so it uses maybe 10-20 watts more than idle on my GPU to do this. But I've only had to do that with minecraft and it's probably because AMD's openGL support on windows is not nearly as good as it is on Linux.",4,False,1jqbogm

"Fedora dont loock back

Fedora, beginner to expert, bleeding edge, stable, and a pure GNOME or KDE environment.

First with Fedora make sure you enable RPM Fusion. Read the RPM Fusion instructions on how to install  the NVIDIA drivers. Very easy.

It's better to learn the command line before anything else. It's easy and quick to learn. Plently of good short YouTube videos that cover the basic. Lean dnf, vim, ohmyzsh, and tmux. Go through vimtutor. That will get you better off with the command line. You'll get things done alot faster in the terminal.

gnome-tweaks has a setting that makes it easier to enable the minimize maximize window buttons.

sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks

I also use a few GNOME extensions

\- Dash to Dock

\- Apps Menu

\- Places Status Indicator

The distribution diversity of Linux has some upsides, but if Fedora, Debian and Mint/LMDE were the only PC distros that existed, 95% of desktop users wouldn't be any less contented with their Linux setup.

"Linux is linux.

There are only a handful of practical ""foundation"" distributions today:  maybe Debian, Red Hat, Arch, etc.  The reason this is hard to explain is...well, here is a map of some linux distributions:  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux\_Distribution\_Timeline.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg)

Most distros are derivatives of these foundational ones.  Essentially, they start with these as a foundation (and are compatible with these); and then they add preinstalled apps, customizations, and software repositories.  For example, Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian.  And Mint is a derivative of Ubuntu.  I'd guess that Mint Debian edition bypasses the Ubuntu customizations and starts with Debian and then adds back in its own customizations.

Regardless, all of the ones you listed are essentially Debian-based.  And .deb (Debian) app packages should work on all of them.

The main difference in the ""foundations"" are back-end stuff that isn't that important.  For example, one difference is the default ""package manager""--the ""command-line app store"".  Arch uses the command 'pacman'; Red Hat uses 'rpm'; and Debian uses 'apt'.  But a few reasons you shouldn't care is that:

* all of these essentially do the same thing (install / update / uninstall apps)
* nowadays, you don't need the command line because you will have a graphical app store.  The app store chooses the right command for your distro automatically
* if you did need the command line, there is plenty of documentation on all
* We now have universal app installers that work on all distros (eg. flatpak, appimage, snap)

Another difference is the distro's repositories--the databases or ""stores"" that contain all of the app installers for that distro.  But you can always connect to other repositories (for example for newer versions of apps); or you can just use the universal repositories like flathub, which doesn't care which distro you're on.",3,False,1jp834j
"Adding to my last comment.  I personally selected Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (""long term support""), because:

* It is popular and mainstream
* It is stable.  It doesn't just update to latest version of major system components that could be buggy
* Non-major apps, like an office suite, are the latest versions
* Unlike Debian, it has a predictable, predetermined release schedule.  The LTS versions are released in April every 2 years (version 24.04 means ""April 2024"").
* Though it's free, it is backed by a commercial entity that supports paid enterprise customers.  They have to keep Ubuntu stable
* Even though it offers a new major version every 2 years, it supports the older version for at least 5 years.  And the upgrades to the next major version are fairly straightforward anyway
* It's not some weird fork of another distro that won't exist in a few years, or comes with a minor niche desktop environment, or only has a handful of people working on it.

For me, Ubuntu LTS is a good balance between stability, predictability, being modern, using mainstream components, having good documentation, etc.

From what it sounds like, I'd recommend you try Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS.  It's a good foundation.  Ubuntu comes with the gnome desktop (that I described earlier & described a few clicks to make it windows-like).  If it doesn't feel right and you want something else, then also try installing:

* KDE desktop:  [https://itsfoss.com/install-kde-on-ubuntu/](https://itsfoss.com/install-kde-on-ubuntu/)
* Cinnamon desktop:  [https://gcore.com/learning/how-to-install-cinnamon-on-ubuntu](https://gcore.com/learning/how-to-install-cinnamon-on-ubuntu)

Then, any time you are at the login screen, you can select which of those 3 desktop environments you want to use for that session, using your same login info.  And notably, **any apps you install or files you save will work in all 3 desktop environments**.  ie. If you install an office suite in KDE and save some documents, you'll have that same office suite and those same documents saved when you log in to gnome or cinnamon.

(When you log in to Cinnamon, you are basically using and trying out Linux Mint, without having to reinstall everything).

As I mentioned, I've been on Linux for 20+ years, and I still routinely try out multiple desktops every few years.  I just tried out KDE again last week, didn't like it.  So I logged out of KDE, logged back into gnome, and deleted KDE.

So try these three out--and whichever one resonates and feels mostly right, keep it and delete the other two.  Using Ubuntu as your ""foundation.""",3,True,1jp834j
"Also, (for me to link in the future): Here's a step-by-step guide of what I would do if I were in your shoes.

1. Download & install [Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
2. Once you log in, go to the ""Extensions"" app (or links below), and 1-click install the following extensions:  [ArcMenu](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3628/arcmenu/), [Desktop Icons NG](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2087/desktop-icons-ng-ding/), [Dash to Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/).  (These extensions are plugins to make gnome feel more like windows, but there are tons of other ones too).
3. Install [Flatpak](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-flatpak-on-ubuntu)
4. Install [OnlyOffice](https://flathub.org/apps/org.onlyoffice.desktopeditors)

Start there, and see how that works for you.  You can customize the extensions if you want--like make ArcMenu feel more like the Windows Start menu--it's got some presets.  (To customize, go into the Extensions app and click the settings of the extension you want to adjust).  Then explore apps over on flathub, install whatever else you want, use the computer.

If after that, you don't like the system (or just want to see what other options you have), then:

* Install [KDE](https://itsfoss.com/install-kde-on-ubuntu/) (a different desktop environment)

Your apps and files from gnome will still be there, so no need to reinstall anything or try a different distro.  (Gnome will still be there too in your login options).  Try KDE out.

If you don't like KDE, follow the instructions there on how to delete KDE and just log back into gnome.  Then:

* Install [Cinnamon](https://itsfoss.com/install-cinnamon-on-ubuntu/) (another desktop environment, used by Mint)

Also, as you use these, google around for how to make (x) desktop environment feel like Windows.",3,False,1jp834j
"Ctrl+alt+F2 will push you to a pure text console so you can fix your driver issue.

"In general popular distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint and Debian to name some, are very reliable. If something breaks, it's likely user error.

As a little tip for the future. Setup ssh access to your computer using private key pairs. That way if anything goes wrong, you always have access to it from another device. Tutorial below for anyone who cares.

Another thing to do is to setup a backup software like Timeshift to do regular backups to another drive. If you can, setup the tried and tested 3-2-1 backup method. 3 Copies on 2 different media and 1 off site.

You mentioned nVidia driver issues causing a black screen. I'm going to guess you installed the driver from nVidia's website like you would on Windows. That's a big **nono**. ALWAYS use the system's own driver manager(Conveniently named as Driver Manager) to install GPU drivers. That way, when the system updates, your GPU driver doesn't break.

SSH Key login setup: `cd ~`/ #Goes to your home directory. 

Making keys: `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C ""Comment Here""` \#Makes the key in current user's /home/.ssh directory. 

Sending keys to other devices: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -p PORT USER@HOST` \#This copies the public key over to your other machine assuming it has sshd running, port 22 (or custom port) open and password login allowed.

Connecting with a key: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ssh://USER@IP_ADDRESS:PORT` (No need for PORT if it's the default 22.)

Setting up quick connect: `nano ~/.ssh/config`

This is what you'll paste in there with CRTL + Shift + V: 

    Host myhost #Can be anything alphanumeric, lower case no spaces. 
    Hostname      IP_Address #Computer IP 
    User          USER 
    Port          Port #Default is 22 
    IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Connecting with quick connect: 

`ssh myhost`

Manually adding keys to autorized\_keys file: 

`mkdir ~/.ssh` \#Makes the default SSH key directory. 

`sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh`	\#Makes it have RWX permissions for the owner. 

`sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` \#Opens authorized\_keys file

Paste in their pub key and save file with CTRL + X, Y, Enter.

`sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` \# Makes the file permissions to owner can RW.

You'll also need to open port 22 in your computer's firewall for ssh connections. 

`sudo ufw allow 22 comment ""SSH Port""` Or you can use the Firewall app if you want to do it in a GUI. Don't under any circumstances open this port to the internet from your router! At least not if you are still using password login for ssh.

Once you have verified that key login actually works go disable ssh password login for security reasons!:

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` \#Edit the following lines:

    PasswordAuthentication yes -> PasswordAuthentication no
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes -> ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
    PermitRootLogin yes -> PermitRootLogin no

`systemctl restart ssh` \#Restart SSH

`sudo systemctl enable sshd` \#Enables ssh demon on startup. Required for ssh connections from other devices.

Ubuntu can be nice since its the far most common begginer distro so there is so increadibly much documentation and old forums threads you can check when you run into a problem.

How to backup? Unplugging Linux should keep it safe while you install Windows but... you do need to have a backup plan. When I was booting Windows I'd oftentimes use the free version of Macrium Reflect. Now I use timeshift and a few other methods.",3,False,1jruriv

I have one internal 4tb ssd for data and one with win10 installed of some programs that require windows (for now).

When installing Debian I simply chose the external drive and that's it.

However, if the stick is removed it boots into grub because the pc doesn't know what to do.

Since I don't care, I just boot into the one-time boot menu and select the windows drive manually.",3,False,1jq3poi

"It's strange to me that you mentioned opening a terminal, because even the slowest of terminals should open a window pretty much instantly.


As far as I can tell there are four probable suspects:


1. The window manager
2. The launcher/taskbar
3. The drive and/or filesystem
4. Flatpak doing weird stuff


The first two are parts of the desktop environment, and given you said you've tried a bunch of distros I'd be surprised if it was that, but it could be an easy fix if you've somehow used the same DE on all of them and all of the versions of that DE have had the issue.


The third option shouldn't be causing issues, but if you're using am ntfs partition (a filesystem format which windows uses by default) it's not outside the realm of possibility. You can try running a live USB to see if that changes anything (keep in mind a live usb has to read everything off the usb drive, so you will still have slower app startups than windows, but if they've improved you know whats wrong).


The fourth is very unlikely, but in the event that you installed all the software as flatpaks there could be something weird going on there. There shouldn't be, but who knows.


One other thing to possibly try is run a simple command in a terminal. This can really be any command, such as the `echo` command which will just spit whatever you put after it back at you*. You want it to ideally be a quick command, so you can see if there's any delay when running it. You might also want to try this with a few different programs, especially larger ones, which might make a startup issue more apparent.


Oh also maybe you've somehow got a virus or something but considering you've tried multiple distros I doubt that. Anti viruses could genuinely cause that though as well, windows defender is notorious for slowing down file accesses on windows for example, and most developers try to find ways around that limitation by packing all their data into one big file instead of a hundred smaller ones.

"There are a few studios who only works with linux and they have great jobs on their portfolio. It is possible, but it depends on a full change of workflow, and maybe, changing also what you will produce.

I am graduated in Graphic design, but I am now working more with project management and doing a PhD, and I started changing to linux gradualy. I have already done a full DebConf branding materials using inkscape, gimp and so on. I think the full resources are on Debians Git called Salsa but I have some illustrations in my site [https://maierjefferson.me/debconf-2019/](https://maierjefferson.me/debconf-2019/)
