"First off, you're an awesome mom for supporting your child's excitement about esports... It’s amazing how gaming can help build friendships and confidence, especially for kids who sometimes feel left out.

Your current M92p is actually not a bad start, but Marvel Rivals likely requires graphics capabilities that the integrated graphics on that machine might struggle with. Here’s an affordable solution you could try.

Add a low profile graphics card. Since you have a small form factor PC, you'll need a low profile graphics card like a GTX 1030 or GTX 1050 Ti (used or refurbished to save money). These cards are affordable, reliable, and usually petty easy to install.

Upgrade RAM if possible. While 8 gigs of RAM is decent, adding a bit more (to 12 or 16) can also help with overall stability and smoothness. Especially for gaming.

Check Drivers and Software...

\- Make sure all your Windows updates and graphics drivers are fully updated.

\-Verify your steam files: (Right click on Marvel Rivals in Steam > Properties > Installed Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files).

Optimize settings. After installing graphics card, set Marvel Rivals to run on the lowest graphics settings to boost performance.

Also, don't hesitate to ask if your school's esports program or local tech clubs might have used components or could help with installation.

Good luck! Hope your kid has a fantastic time at the tournament!",4,True,1jirypc

GeForce now is $10/month.,52,False,1jirypc
"GeForce Now has a 'free' tier that he could use to practice, but you have to wait in line to play. Once he gets to the actual tournament, you'll have to pony up the monthly fee for a bit. Having tried a few streaming services while I was quarantined away from my family (and gaming PC) during COVID, GeForce now is the best of them in terms of performance, and at $10/month is is by far the most affordable way to play PC games.

Also, to put this in perspective for you, the people who are hating on GFN in here have gaming PCs that they spent between $750 and $10k on and think that you can't compete without one. Will you win first place using GeForce now? Probably not. Can you still join in and have fun playing, and still beat players who aren't top-tier in skill? Absolutely.

Now, if at some point you have $350 available, grab an old HP Z420 workstation off ebay with the following specs, should be about $150:
CPU = E2697v2
RAM = at least 32GB
SSD = at least 256 GB

Then find either an AMD Radeon RX6600 or an nVidia RTX 3060 off ebay (should be < $200) and have a tech savvy friend install it for you. You now have the cheapest semi-competent gaming PC that you can build to run a game like that at low settings.

The reality of the situation is that there is an extreme shortage of graphics accelerators right now, so PC gaming is expensive as a result. That RX6600 that I told you to buy off Ebay for $200 was selling NEW for less than that when on sale a year ago. It's a bad time for PC gaming.

EDIT: If you want something that doesn't require some assembly, you can get something like this off aliexpress (the exact CPU you want is a 7735HS, it's just fast enough to play that game and 720P (low resolution), but still moderately affordable): https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806208954672.html ... you want at least 32GB RAM and 256GB SSD.

"There's three things I can think of that might have happened:

1) Your computer is connected to a power strip and must have either a) pressed the reset/off switch on the strip b) ran too much power through the strip and popped a fuse.

In this case, try unplugging your computer and try a trusted outlet (one that charges your phone or something).

2) Your PSU switch isn't set to on.

3) Check if your Motherboard has its 24-pin connector loose (or any power connector loose). You can also check if there's any debugging LED lights when you try turning on the PC from there.

If you have the know-how, try jump starting your pc using the pins on the motherboard instead of the power button on the case.

But most importantly of all! Do not freak out. Do only what you're comfortable with and start simple!

Test outside the pc by checking the outlet you used. Then move onto your PC by checking the power cables from the PSU to your components. Make sure they're not loosely connected. If you're comfortable with it, try taking off the CPU cooler and reseat the CPU. You can leave the cpu cooler on the cpu without fully screwing it in to make sure it works.",20,False,1jn01go

2: remount your cooler. Remove the cooler, scrape off any old thermal paste, reapply paste, then reinstall cooler. Remember to properly tight it down, it should have pretty tight contact with the CPU. Make sure the cable for the fan cooler is plugged in

3: Check your RAM. Motherboards usually have 4 rams slots, but most people use only 2. Wich 2 slots to use is important. For most motherboards, it is optimal to use slots 2 and 4, counting from the CPU (left to right)

"Some general advice 

\- What sits wonderfully for one person may be a medieval torture device for another. There is absolutely NO replacement for testing a chair out. Many of the higher end companies (and many of the refurbishers like crandall or btod - both also have youtube channels comparing chairs) have a test period \~ a month. If you don't like the chair you can trade it for another model. This is my best advice because even sitting in a chair for 2-3 minutes in a showroom isn't a good indicator as to how it's going to feel in 4-5 hours 7x week.

\- for the most part, ignore ""gaming"" chairs. The majority of them take race car designed seats and mate them to a chair... and as anyone who has ever been in a race car can attest, they are world renowned for their comfort and adjustability.... There are some good ones out there, but most sell on ""looking cool"" vs. being a good chair.

\- Herman Miller, Steelcase, Fern, etc... high end brands with high end pricetags. These are chairs that someone spending hours every day of their life sitting in should be considering. Refurbs and Used chairs can help with the price. Steelcase Leap, HM Areon are both proven chairs that will last a lifetime, but as above, only the sitting test will tell if they work for him.

\- \^ To the above, craigslist, fb marketplace, whatever the kids use these days are great ways to pick up high end chairs for next to nothing, depending on where you live.",6,False,1jabzmb

"Do not be like me and chase after the ""perfect"" ergonomic chair and spend thousands. It will not solve your problems.

There's little solid evidence proving that ergonomic chairs provide significant benefits over any other well-built office chair. The idea that an ""ergonomic"" label automatically means better posture, comfort, or health is just another marketing ploy, similar to gaming chairs. Most of these chairs use the same basic design with minor adjustments but slap on the ""ergonomic"" label to justify higher prices.

Meanwhile, studies consistently show that prolonged sitting—regardless of the chair—leads to health issues like back pain, poor circulation, and metabolic problems. The real solution isn't an expensive chair but breaking up sedentary time altogether.

[Standing desks and walking treadmills have been linked to reduced back pain, better energy levels, and improved metabolic health.](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2012/11_0323.htm)

[A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that people should spend at least 2-4 hours per workday standing or moving to counteract the negative effects of sitting.](https://www.bmj.com/company/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/COI.pdf)

[Even NASA research suggests that frequent low-level movement is more effective than sitting in any ""ergonomic"" position for long-term health.](https://nsc.nasa.gov/docs/default-source/sma-focus/smafocus_ergonomics_for508ing_revsd2.pdf?sfvrsn=f583f4f8_6)

So instead of dropping thousands on a chair with minor lumbar adjustments, invest in a standing desk, a walking treadmill, and whatever basic chair you can afford for when you need to sit. Your body will thank you way more than any overpriced ""ergonomic"" chair ever could.",26,True,1jabzmb

By my own experience a good ergonomic chair will still make a difference if you prefer sitting to standing.

The elephant in the room is not your furniture, it's how you spend your time not sitting. In my case that also means taking short breaks from sitting on a regular basis. If you do not have compensation for the time sitting and your lifestyle is unhealthy you are right, then even the best ergonomic chair will make no difference in the longrun, but neither will a standing desk.",5,False,1jabzmb

That’s the secret big-brand “ergonomic” chair companies don’t want you to know—any chair can work as long as you alternate between sitting and standing.
